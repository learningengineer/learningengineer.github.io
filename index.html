                <div class="col-2-of-2">This is a letter jumble spelling tester.  The audio tells the student the word, repeats it in a sentence, and then states the word again.  The student then places the letter tiles onto the place holders. A SCORM version that can be loaded into an LMS can be found using this link:

                </div>
                <div class="col-2-of-2">Find the Subject requires that the learner find the subject in a sentence by simply clicking on the word in the sentece.  This interface is a lot more intuitive and requires fewer interactions and is less complex.  I have made several variations of this that include finding the verb and finding the error.  I have other variations of this including a Level 1 and a Find the Verb Level 1 & 2.  These have also been converted into SCORM packages for uploading into an LMS.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="col-2-of-2">I wrote this book back when I was teaching composition and found that most writing books were heavy on grammar and usage but nothing about content.  It contains a text to speech engine so that students can have the book read to them.  The book focuses more on content, such as providing factual support for claims rather than baseless opinion, than it does on grammar and usage.

                <div class="col-2-of-2">This is a variation of Find the Subject.  Here you are finding the Subject / Verb error.  Click on the problem in the sentence.  The user gets three attempts.  After three attempts, the user is told the correct answer and an explanation of the correct answer is provided.  This also comes in a SCORM package.</div>

                <div class="col-2-of-2">I created this SCORM application for an LMS.  Using "adaptive release," you can require students to fill out the checklist for revision before they are able to upload their assignment.  This comes in a SCORM package as well.</div>

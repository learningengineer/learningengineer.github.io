<h3>Table of Contents</br></h3>	
</br>
<h4>1</br>
Introduction</br></h4>
     <p> If you are taking this course, it’s because you are not proficient in writing.  It’s ok.  
Lots of people have difficulty writing.  Seventy-three percent of twelfth graders are not 
proficient in writing (National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2011), so you can 
see that you are not alone.  However, writing is still the dominant form of 
communication: it’s cheap and effective.  Being able to write well is very important to 
your future professional life.  Often, students don’t even realize how important writing is 
to their profession.  Take culinary arts for example; you might not think that writing is 
that important to a culinary arts student but think about this.  In the UK, the chef Jamie 
Oliver is second in books sales only to JK Rowling (Harry Potter books) (NewsCore, 
2010).</p>
     <p> Mistakes can be costly.  For example, the Yellow Pages changed “Exotic Travel” to 
“Erotic Travel,” and it cost them $10,000,000. (Associated Press, 1988) NASA lost a 
$5,000,000 satellite because someone mislabeled the measurements (CNN, 1999).  
Writing is the single-most important skill any professional can possess.  
	Writing is a process.  The writing process consists of five steps: prewriting, 
planning, drafting, revising, and proofreading.  Expert writers don’t follow all these 
steps in order; expert writers will skip around.  In fact, expert writers will revise and 
proofread while drafting an essay.  However, you are probably not an expert writer, so 
we will be looking at all these steps in order.  </p>

<h4>2</br>
How Language Shapes Thought</h4>
       <p> The words you use shape the way you think.  So, as you traverse your way 
through college, your vocabulary will expand, and that expansion will alter the way you 
perceive the world.  For example, experts tend to see the world through their lens of 
expertise, such as when experts in baseball became confused by the word plate when it 
wasn’t used to refer to home plate (Chi, 2006).  </p> 
 <p> 	In Australia, an aboriginal girl with eyes closed, knows exactly which direction is 
north.  She knows immediately without hesitation.  Ask that same question to a bunch of 
eggheads at Harvard, and first, there will be a pause, and then, maybe a guess or no 
answer at all. The aboriginal girl, it is believed, has this gift because of the structure of 
the language she uses whereby everything is referenced as a direction on the compass 
because their language is the language of traveling.  They do not ask each other how they 
are doing, they ask each other where they are going and by going, they mean a specific 
direction.  If you are limping, they might ask why your western leg hurts.  Or about that 
new car parked on the north-side of your house (Boroditsky, 2011). </p> 
<p>	A dental student will no longer see teeth, they will see molars, incisors, and 
cuspids.  A nursing student will no longer simply see the flu, they will see H1N3. Your 
language will become more precise and more accurate.  </p>
<h4>3</br>
Words</h4>
	<p>Words are the building blocks of language and writing. However, they are not 
indivisible.  Words can be further broken down into prefixes, roots, and suffixes.  
Understanding some common word parts can help you when you encounter new words, 
increase your vocabulary, and help you to become a more proficient and successful 
writer.  </p>
<p>	There are many words that people use incorrectly.  One of the best examples are 
prefixes, which are smaller words we add to the beginnings of words to change them,  
semi- or bi-.  According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, Semi- means  “half in 
quantity or value : half of or occurring halfway through a specified period of time 
semiannual semimonthly.”  So, semimonthly means twice a month usually at the 15th 
and 30th of the month.  Semiannual means twice a year at 6 month intervals.  People 
often confuse semimonthly with bimonthly.  Bimonthly means every two months and 
biweekly means every two weeks.  So, semimonthly is very close to biweekly, but they 
are different, so you need to be careful.  </p>
<p>	The prefix “a” as in atypical or atheist basically means “not.”  So, atypical means 
not typical and atheist means not a theist.  Some other words that start with the “a” 
prefix are amorphous which means “without form,” acellular which means “without 
cells,” arrhythmia which means “without rhythm,” or anoxia meaning “without oxygen.”  </p>
	
	

<h4>4</br>
The Order of Importance</h4>
<p>	When an article is submitted to a publication like the New Yorker, it goes through 
an extensive review process.  It begins with a “fact checker.”  This is an editor who reads 
through the article and checks to see that the statements made in it are accurate and 
factual.  This is an important legal process for publications because of slander and 
defamation.  For example, Gawker was sued for an article entitled, “The Greatest Scam 
in Tech.”  This article made a series of accusations against a company called Peep 
Telephony which you can find here, https://gizmodo.com/5726071/the-greatest-scam-
in-tech.  In the article, the author makes quite a few derogatory comments about the 
company Peep Telephony.  However, the defamation suit was slapped down because the 
author had citations to back up his assertions.  He used Peep Telephony’s own videos 
and promotional materials.  This is the type of thing a fact checker would look at.   
So, the most important thing in an essay, article, or research paper are facts 
that can be backed up with credible sources.  Had the author of the Gawker 
article not provided citations and examples from Peep Telephony, the lawsuit would 
probably have been affirmed for the plaintiff.   You want to use facts supported by 
evidence because that’s what saves you from a slander or a defamation lawsuit.  </p>
<p>	The second most important thing is to avoid using logical fallacies and personal 
bias.  Logical fallacies and personal biases both involve the writer making errors in logic.  
In the case of logical fallacies, the three most import to avoid are arguing from 
ignorance, false cause, and anecdotal.   </p>
<p>	Arguing from ignorance means that you’re writing about something that you 
don’t really know anything about but think you do.  An excellent example of this comes 
from an essay by a student entitled, “The Benefits of Being of Low Socio-Economic 
Status.”  In more simple terms, “It’s Good to be Poor.”  Yes, that’s right.  This essay 
argued that the poor have it great.  The essay claimed that the poor have everything paid 
for.  If a poor person gets sick and must go to the hospital, it’s completely covered.  By 
contrast, middle-class people can have their car and home taken away if they don’t pay 
their bills.  This essay had no citations and no references.  The information was based on 
hearsay and gossip.  In other words, this essay had no basis in fact or evidence, but the 
student was still promoting it as true.   The other side of arguing from ignorance is the 
“burden of proof.”</p>
	 
<p>	This fallacy involves making assertions or accusations that have no basis in fact 
or evidence.  Taken far enough, making false claims can be fraudulent.  For example, the 
learning program Hooked on Phonics®, which costs approximately $230, settled with 
the Federal Trade Commission over claims it made in its commercials.  Hooked on 
Phonics® claimed that it could teach anyone to read even those with reading disabilities 
like Dyslexia yet provided no evidence to support its claims in its commercial or to the 
FTC.  Therefore, Hooked on Phonics® had to remove their commercials from television 
(Nathans, 2015).  Another example involves a group of reactionaries who call themselves 
the Birthers. They have accused former President Obama of being a Kenyan, not an 
American, who is also Muslim, not a Christian, even though they present no evidence to 
support their absurd accusations.  In fact, they have filed lawsuits against the president; 
however, every single attempt has been thrown out by the courts.  (Smith, 2009) 
Birthers harm our democracy by undermining the truth and spreading lies, making it 
difficult for voters to make informed decisions.   To sum up the burden of proof, 
remember this pointed line from Mayor Bloomberg: “In God we trust, everyone else 
bring data.”  </p>
   <p>   Finally, we have the logically fallacy of false cause.  False cause usually occurs 
when people confuse correlation or coincidence with causation.  Just because two events 
coincide, it does not mean that one is the cause of the other.  Correlation is easy to 
prove, causation is not.  For example, one of the most popular topics for false cause is 
the drop in the murder rate.  Some think that the drop was the result of abortion 
becoming legal (Levitt, 2015).  Some think it because environmental lead, mostly from 
paint and gasoline, has been slowly removed from the environment (Casciani, 2015).  
And some even think that the murder rate has gone down because more people are 
surviving being shot due to the fact that level one trauma centers are near where crime 
occurs (Fields & McWhirter, 2015).  The problem here is that policies, which cost 
money, are made based on the belief that one thing causes another without any evidence 
that it does thus possibly wasting a lot of time and money.  </p>
<p>	The other problem with false cause is that it has led to wrongheaded policies, 
such as doctors telling parents not to let their child sleep with the light on for fear it will 
cause short sightedness: it doesn't.  It turned out that children with short-sightedness 
prefer to sleep with the light on (Smeets, 2012).  This undermines the credibility of 
science.  </p>
<p>	Another example comes from the field of education.  Researchers in the 1970s 
notices a correlation between self-esteem and good grades.  This led some to conclude 
that if a child has high self-esteem, they will get good grades.  However, this turned out 
to be false.  In turns out that students with high grades have high self-esteem because of 
the accomplishment of having high grades.  In fact, the result of the self-esteem 
movement is that we now have a lot of people who falsely think they are more intelligent 
than they are, which hurts their future career prospects by allowing them to falsely 
believe they are competent when they are not (Smeets, 2012).</p>
<h4>4</br>
Prewriting</h4>
It’s the reader, stupid. 
<p>	As a writer, it’s important to remember that writing isn’t about you.  It’s about the 
reader.  The poor soul who must read whatever you thought good enough for them to 
use their very valuable time on.  Remember that.  In the movie, Walk The Line, there is a 
scene where Johnny Cash and his band are playing for the great Sam Phillips of Sun 
Records and Sam tells Johnny that he doesn’t believe him.  That he doesn’t believe his 
rendition of the song. The reader needs to believe that you believe in what you’re writing 
about.  As Sam says to Johnny, let’s say you got hit by a truck and while you’re lying in 
the ditch you had just one song you could sing, just one song to tell the world and god 
how you felt.  What would you sing?   </p>
What would you write?  

<h4>Picking topics</h4>
<p>	Picking topics to write about is one of the most difficult aspects of writing.  Most 
writing classes overlook this, but students need it.  Here are the rules of picking topics.
<ol>
<li>Be original.   
Don’t write about guns, abortion, marijuana, drunk driving or any other topic 
that has been done to death.  There is nothing more boring and a bigger waste of 
the reader’s time than you, the writer, rehashing the same old topic because you 
were too lazy to come up with something original.</li> 
<li>Let someone else pick your topic.   
There are all kinds of essay and writing contests where the topic has already been 
selected.  The key here is to find a new way of looking at the topic.  An original 
point of view.  For example, there is a contest essay about texting and driving.  
The instructions state, “The purpose of this scholarship is to help you understand 
the risks of texting while driving.” So remember to emphasize the risks and the 
outcomes of those risks of texting while driving.</li>
<li>	Write what you know or what you are willing to learn about.   
Take an inventory of your interests and knowledge.  What do you know?  For 
example, I know about fixing appliances, cars, bicycles, and computers.  I know 
about cutting down trees and chopping wood.  I know a lot about writing, editing, 
APA style, and science.  And, if I don’t know something, I am willing to learn 
about it but not in a superficial half-assed manner that isn’t convincing like too 
many writers do.  </li>
<li>The best way to pick a topic is to take something that you’re interested in and 
explore it further.  For example, let’s say that you like listening to music, and you 
use Pandora a music streaming service.  You could write about how the artists get 
paid.  Or, you could write about why LP’s are making a comeback.  Or, what the 
difference is between analog and digital music.  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Researching</h4>
	<p>Researching information for your writing requires work.  Too often students 
skimp on this part, and it shows.  In most cases, students have already come up with a 
thesis that they believe to be true and then find only that information that supports what 
they already believe to be true. 
How to research.</p>
<p>	The easiest way to perform research is with a search, usually at Google.  However, 
you will want to perform specialized searches instead of generic searches.  For example, 
instead of typing body cameras into a Google search box, type, site:gov body 
cameras. It will restrict your search to Government sites.  You could also perform a 
more an even more specific search by typing in site:fbi.gov body cameras.  This 
search would only search through the FBI’s website.  You can do the same with any 
portion of a web domain name.  If you’re in any field of medicine, searching cdc.gov is 
a great idea.  For business majors, searching bls.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics) is a 
great idea or the Small Business Administration at sba.gov.  For more information on 
using Google search operators, you can find it here: https://neilpatel.com/blog/google-
search-operators/</p>
      Using Wikipedia, WebMD, and other commercial sites.  
<p>	Don’t use Wikipedia, WebMD or most commercial (.com) websites because in 
most cases they aren’t primary sources of information.  Wikipedia is secondary source of 
information.  You can use secondary sources when doing research to help you find other 
sources.  For example, in Wikipedia, the Footnotes are a treasure trove of primary 
source material that you can use.  </p>
 
The above image is a screen shot from the Footnotes section of a Wikipedia article on 
the Halifax Explosion.  Take a look at it for a minute.  
<p>	The blue colored text are links to the sources that have been cited in the article.  
It’s best to click on those links and then use those sources rather than Wikipedia. 
Style Guides</p>
<p>	What is a style guide?  A style guide consists of the rules of formatting and styling 
your paper.  This includes how a title page is formatted, for example.  Where the pages 
are numbered.  How a paper is cited.  I have used several different styles over the years: 
Turabian, MLA, and APA.  Each time I was expected to adapt to the style being used 
because that’s what will be expected of you in the world of work.  As of this writing, I 
have my students use the American Psychological Association’s Style Guide.  Most style 
guides have a published book that teaches you about it 
(https://www.amazon.com/Publication-Manual-American-Psychological-
Association/dp/1433805618) or you can simply use the APA own style blog at 
http://blog.apastyle.org  which is really the best source because it is a primary source 
direct from the publisher of the book and up-to-date.  Some teachers like to use Purdue 
University’s OWL (Online Writing Lab) as a source, but this is a secondary source and is 
completely uncited.  </p>
<h4>Sources</h4>
  <p>    If you’re a student, and you’re writing about something other than yourself, you 
will need sources.  You need credible sources because you don’t even have a degree, so 
you aren’t an expert enough in much of anything other than yourself.  Think of it like 
this: would a judge consider you an expert witness?  You may think that you are, but you 
aren’t.  It’s a true fact.  </p>
 <p>     For example, I once read an essay that claimed we should drug test people on 
welfare because it would save money and because people in the military are drug tested.  
The problem is that neither claim is valid.  First, drug testing has been tried many times, 
and it has always been a waste of money (Cunha, 2014).  Second, military personnel are 
employees; they have an employment contract.  People who receive welfare are receiving 
a public good entitled to them by law.  They are presumed innocent until proven guilty 
before they can be denied this public good.  In another example, a student claimed that 
the drinking age in the US has been 21 for hundreds of years.  First, states determine 
their drinking ages, and in the state of Wisconsin, the drinking age was changed to 21 in 
the 1980s and not hundreds of years ago.  How do I know?  I was seventeen when the 
change first occurred.  I was a primary witness to the change.  </p> 
  <h4>There are two types of sources--primary and secondary sources. </h4>
<h4>Primary Sources</h4>
<ul>
	<li>US Government Statistics.
<p>Not all governments are transparent.  US government statistics are open to 
rigorous scrutiny, which is why they are credible. For example, the 
unemployment rate is partially determined by survey data.  The Bureau of 
Labor Statistics publishes the exact methods used to generate those 
statistics, so you could easily replicate them if you wanted to. </li> 
	<li>Controlled Experiments Published in peer reviewed journals
		The journals Science and Nature are great examples of peer reviewed 
journals.  You can also find peer-reviewed journals in the college’s online library.  My 
college uses the Ebsco host, which allows you to filter your searches to peer-reviewed 
journals only. </li>
	<li>First hand accounts by eyewitnesses
	You see these often as interviews recorded by police officers, reporters, 
journalists, and cameramen.  All journalists record interviews.  It’s a legal thing.</li>  
<li>	News stories reported at the time</li>
<li>	Trial transcripts</li>
<li>	Police reports</li>
	<li>Diaries and journals</li>
<li>	Documents created at the time like emails. </li> 
<h4>Secondary Sources</h4>
<li>Wikipedia</li>	
	<li>WebMD</li>
	<li>Encyclopedias</li>
	<li>OWL at Purdue University</li>
	<li>Most commercial websites</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fake News</h4>
	What is fake news?   
<p>	Everyone makes mistakes and the news media is no different.  Credible 
publications and broadcast stations print or state what are known as “Corrections.”  
Corrections are notes or statements that correct past stories in previous editions.  On 
the Internet, articles where mistakes have been made are corrected, but a note is placed 
at the bottom of the page noting the correction and what had been previously reported.  
This is called honesty.  Honesty means credibility.  Sometimes people confuse an honest 
mistake with a vast conspiracy yet provide no evidence of the conspiracy other than to 
point to a handful of cherry-picked mistakes that undoubtedly support some prior 
belief.  </p>
<p>	Most fake news comes in the form of phony press releases from businesses or 
non-profit organizations owned by businesses looking to generate sensationalism or 
hysteria.  One example is the website americaspower.org, which represents the 
American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.  There is no such thing as clean coal.  It 
produces CO2 and mercury.  The mercury from coal is the reason why you should 
restrict how much fish you eat. (CDC, 2016)</p>
<p>Facts and Evidence.
Here is something that a student once wrote in an essay.  
She claimed that President Trump was a misogynist, weak minded and had a 
hatred for immigrants. None of her claims could be proven as true. Trump’s 
wives have almost always had a roll [sic] within his company, his family 
immigrated as well as his current wife and has had to do some extensive damage 
control for himself over the years. Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton's slanderous ads 
had no prevail as Trump won the presidency and is currently the president.</p>

<p>Let’s look at what was stated here.</p>
    First, the student claims that none of Hillary Clinton’s claims could be proven 
true.  This is false.  Donald Trump is a misogynist because he was literally caught on a 
recording stating how he can grope women whenever he wants.  He then apologized for 
what he said.  A recording and a confession are plenty of evidence to support the claim.
      <p>Second, the student claims that there is no evidence that Donald Trump has a 
hatred for immigrants.  This ignores words that have come out of Donald Trump’s own 
mouth.  Does he have a hatred for all immigrants? No, just those that allow him to score 
political points.  Let’s look at some of the things Donald Trump has said about 
immigrants.
<p>"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're sending 
people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're 
bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are 
good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're 
getting."
<p>Donald Trump provides no evidence to support his claims. In fact, his claims have been 
debunked by credible news outlets like the New York Times, which presents evidence to 
support its claims (Perez-Pena, 2017).
<p>	In another paper, a student claimed that Western medicine is missing out on 
“traditional” medicine.  The problem is that there is only medicine.  Treatments such as 
chiropractic care, acupuncture, and homeopathy need to be proven to be effective in 
randomized double-blind clinical trials or they are just more snake oil. 
<p>	You want to be able to support your assertions with facts and evidence and not 
speculation, hyperbole, or hysteria.  If we don’t, then we end up with Snake-oil salesmen 
peddling garbage and false hope. As future professionals, you have a duty to stand up for 
the truth and not some imaginary truth biased by our false beliefs.  
Getting It Wrong
    <p>  Sometimes writers, scientists, and politicians make mistakes.  Sometimes they 
need to change their mind because they’re wrong.  Sometimes we must go with the 
information we have.  For example, our understanding of gravity has changed 
throughout the years. Newton’s gravity couldn’t explain the path of the planet Mercury 
around the sun, but Einstein’s could.  Now Einstein’s concept has been put to the test by 
the Voyager spacecraft, which is so far from earth and any form of gravity that it isn’t 
where it is calculated to be.  Therefore, science dictates that when the facts and evidence 
change so should our decisions.  An inability to change your opinion based on the facts 
and evidence is unprofessional behavior.  
Planning
<p>	Once you’ve done your research, you need to start planning your essay. This is 
important because it’s going to save you a lot of time and effort.  First, if you did your 
research correctly, you should have a lot more information than you can ever use. This is 
where an outline comes in handy.  It is my experience that students who use outlines get 
better grades and waste less time writing.  This is because the outline helps you think 
about what is and isn’t important.  
<p>	Essays on broad topics need to be trimmed down because you’re writing an essay 
and not a book. For example, I once read an essay by a student about Israel.  The essay 
was very disorganized.  One fact jumped to another unrelated fact.  In one paragraph, 
the student is writing about the Dead Sea and in the next sentence about the Seven Day 
War.  So, I simply started writing an outline, and I told the student to pick three things 
that they felt were important about Israel--just three.  Not everything. 
<p>	An essay outline is very simple.  Here is an example.<br>
1.	Introduction.<br>
a.	Why is this essay important? <br> Why should the reader read this essay?<br>  Why 
should the reader change their mind about this or that?  <br>
b.	Forecast statement.  What is this essay about? <br>
2.	First topic that follows the forecast statement<br>
a.	First point<br>
b.	Second point<br>
3.	Second topic that follows the forecast statement<br>
a.	First point<br>
b.	Second point<br>
4.	Third topic that follows the forecast statement<br>
a.	First point<br>
b.	Second point<br>
5.	Conclusion.<br>
a.	Restates why this is important. <br>

	<p>The outline helps you to focus your attention and what you think is important for 
the reader to know.  Here are some sample outlines for essays to help you understand 
how they work. </p>
Definition Essay Outline<br>
1.	Introduction<br>
a.	Introduce the reader to professional jargon and lead that into a better 
understanding of the learning process. <br>
b.	Forecast statement: Learning about the split-attention effect will 
help you become a better student and safer person.<br>
2.	What is the Split-Attention Effect?<br>
a.	Textbook Definition  <br>
<p>Instructional split attention occurs when learners are required to split 
their attention between and mentally integrate several sources of 
physically or temporally disparate information, where each source of 
information is essential for understanding the material. Cognitive load is 
increased by the need to mentally integrate the multiple sources of 
information. This increase in extraneous cognitive load is likely to have a 
negative impact on learning compared with conditions where the 
information has been restructured to eliminate the need to split attention. 
(Ayres and Sweller)</p>
b.	Definition in my own words.<br>
i.	Examples to illustrate<br>
1.	Child learning to tie their shoes<br>
2.	Math books<br>
3.	Personal Narrative about the Split-Attention Effect.<br>
a.	Correspondence Statistics Course<br>
i.	I was getting a D<br>
ii.	Math book as spatially separate explanations<br>
iii.	Solution<br>
1.	Recorded myself reading book and then listened back to the <br>
audio.<br>
2.	Grade went to an A<br>
4.	Driving while texting is another example<br>

Logical Fallacy: Cherry Picking Outline<br>
1.	Introduction<br>
a.	Definition of what cherry-picking is.<br>
i.	Cherry-picking is the selective use of data, subjects, intervals, and 
methods to support what someone already believes to be true.  <br>
b.	Thesis: Three examples of cherry-picking are “No Excuses” Charter 
Schools, Vivobarefoot®, and PBS Newshour.  <br>
2.	No Excuses™ Charter Schools<br>
a.	No Excuses Charter Schools and charter schools in general use volunteers 
instead of a random selection students from public schools.  The parents of 
children who go to Charter School are different than random parents 
because they are actively involved in their child’s education and are more 
likely to be well-educated themselves.  (Powers and Mathis)<br>
3.	Vivobarefoot ads<br>
a.	Vivobarefoot products are the new running shoes that look like a sock and 
require that the runner hits the ground with the front of their foot rather 
than the back.  They claim that the Vivobarefoot leads to fewer injuries: 
“Harvard study proves that heel strikers have 2x the rate of injury as 
forefoot strikers.”  The problem is that the study didn’t use a random 
selection of joggers from the general population of joggers, but rather, 
from 52 almost “elite” level runners.  Elite runners are more practiced and 
would thus be expected to have fewer injuries.  So, the Vivobarefoot claim 
only counts for elite runners and not the average runner.<br>
4.	PBS Newshour Story in which PBS cherry-picks data in its assertions against 
Success Academies.  <br>
a.	Example:  “But our sources, including several public school principals, 
quite a few former Success Academy parents, and one person inside her 
organization, charge that is exactly what she does, repeatedly suspend certain 
kids to push them out. However, none of these critics were willing to publicly 
confront Moskowitz,” according to John Merrow the reporter from the 
PBSNewshour.  (Merrow)<br>

<h4>Drafting</h4>
	<p>This is the next step in the writing process. In drafting, you take your outline and 
the information you have gathered, and you write your essay.  You want your first draft 
to be informally written.  You want your writing to be readable, and you should write the 
way you speak.  This is what I tell students.  Imagine you are sitting next to a friend, now 
say to them what you are going to write, first.  If you can’t say it before you write it, don’t 
write it. </p>
<br>
 Here are the five simple rules of readable writing.<br>
1.	Short words (Video: The Power of Simple Words). <br>
a.	https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-power-of-simple-words<br>
2.	Short sentences<br>
a.	Excerpt from Bukowski’s Ham on Rye<br>
3.	Active verbs<br>
a.	Action (active) verbs are better than state of being verbs.<br>
i.	Replace “is was were are have had has” as best you can with action <br>
verbs. <br>
b.	Avoid passive voice unless necessary.<br>
i.	When should you use the passive voice?<br>
1.	When you want the victim to be the subject of the sentence.<br> 
2.	Active: Shark attacks surfer.<br>
3.	Passive: Surfer was attacked by shark. <br>
4.	Concrete nouns<br>
a.	Concrete nouns are nouns that you can touch like, well, concrete.  
Concrete nouns are better than abstract nouns because they work nicely 
with our five senses.  They are words that are more than just sounds.  They 
create experiences.  For example, students often tell me that something is 
beautiful, such as in, “The mountains are beautiful.”  The student will then 
go on telling me how the trees are beautiful, and the snow is beautiful and 
so on.  My response is always, show me they’re beautiful, don’t tell me.  If 
you don’t understand what I mean, I have a great example.  The song 
“Jolene” by Dolly Parton is a great example of how concrete nouns can 
help us to understand the abstract concept of beauty.  Here are the lyrics. <br>
Your beauty is beyond compare <br>
With flaming locks of auburn hair <br>
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green <br>
Your smile is like a breath of spring <br>
Your voice is soft like summer rain <br>
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene <br>
<br>
5.	Personal language  <br>
a.	What does this mean?  It means to write the way you speak.  Here is an 
example from Frank Sinatra in a letter he wrote to Mike Royko.  Here is 
the background on the letter.  Frank was in Chicago in the late 1970s 
performing.  About two blocks from his hotel where most of the Chicago 
law enforcement community was apparently hanging out, an elderly 
woman was mugged violently. A columnist for the Chicago Daily News by 
the name of Mike Royko blamed Frank Sinatra. <br> 
b.	Now that you have read the Sinatra letter, did you notice how easy it was 
to read and how concise the language was?  Did you notice that Frank 
doesn’t use any fancy words?  Frank Sinatra, a New Jersey son, writes the 
way he speaks. <br>

<h4>Paraphrasing.</h4>
	<p>Writers use sources for their writing because in most cases, they aren’t experts. 
Good writers can take complex topics and make them easier for the reader to 
understand.  Therefore, one of the most important tools in your writer’s toolbox is 
paraphrasing.  You will paraphrase most of your sources.  You can’t quote everything 
because that would make you an editor and not a writer.</p>  
	<p>The first step in paraphrasing is reading comprehension.  You have to understand 
what you’re reading, and you have to understand all the concepts involved.   This is 
important because paraphrasing requires you to change everything from a source except 
the meaning of what is being stated.  If you don’t understand your source, your 
paraphrased sentences will be worthless.  Keep the meaning.  Change everything else. </p> 
	<p>Here for example, I have a sentence I copied from the New Yorker article “The 
Checklist” written by Dr Atul Gawande, “It was sleek and impressive, with a one 
hundred three-foot wingspan and four engines jutting out from the wings, rather than 
the usual two.”  The first problem with paraphrasing this sentence starts with the word 
“it.”  In order to paraphrase this sentence properly, you need to know what the word “it” 
is referring to or its antecedent.  In this sentence, the word “it” is referring to the Word 
War II, B17 Bomber which was built by Boeing.</p>  
     <p> The second step in paraphrasing is changing the words with synonyms--different 
words same meaning.  Again, it is important to remember that you have to keep the 
meaning of the original words and that you have to match same part of speech with 
same part of speech.  You must replace verbs with verbs, adjectives with adjectives, and 
so on.  If you use a different part of speech, the sentence becomes incoherent.  For 
changing the words, I use a thesaurus.  MS Word has a built-in thesaurus.  If you right 
click on a word, you get a drop down list, and click on synonyms, which drops out and 
down to give you a list of possible synonyms.  Click on one of the words, and it will 
replace the word jealousy in your text. </p> 
<p>From there, you can also open up the thesaurus directly by clicking on thesaurus at the 
bottom of the list.  In Word’s thesaurus, you can see a small (n.) next to the word 
protectiveness.  This means that it is a noun, and you can see that all of the synonyms 
of jealousy are nouns, so this one would be easy to replace. </p> 
<p>If you want or need a more extensive thesaurus, you can use the Power Thesaurus at 
https://www.powerthesaurus.org/ This is the thesaurus I use for two reasons.  First, it’s 
rather easy to use, and second, I don’t always use MS Word for writing and want to use 
something that is always available.  In fact, I used it to help me write this paragraph.  
Initially, I wrote, “If you want or need a more comprehensive thesaurus...” I then 
changed “comprehensive” to “extensive.” </p>
	In our sentence, I am going to highlight all the words I want to find synonyms for. <br>
<br>
It was <mark>sleek</mark> and <mark>impressive</mark>, with a <mark>one hundred three foot</mark> wingspan and <mark>four engines</mark> 
<mark>jutting out</mark> from the <mark>wings</mark>, <mark>rather than the usual two</mark>. 
<br>
Once I completed the changes to the words, I ended up with…
<br>
<p>The B17 was streamlined and striking, featuring an almost 60 yard 
wingspan and a quartet of Boeing engines sticking out from the wings as 
opposed to most planes at that time which only had two. </p>
<br>
<p>As you can see, certain words were impossible to change, such as wingspan and 
wings.  Some words  just can’t be replaced without making the sentence sound 
incoherent or awkward.</p>
	<p>When using the Power Thesaurus, you simply search for a synonym.  Then, you 
can click on any of the recommended synonyms to find synonyms of that word.  In fact, 
you can click on any of the words to see yet more synonyms.  It’s a good idea to check 
out the Power Thesaurus and play around with the website to see what it offers. </p>
<p>	It’s important to be very careful about the words you are using.  It’s always better 
to replace a complex word with a more simple word.  In my paraphrased example, I 
replaced “jutting” with “sticking,” but originally, I wanted to use “extruding,” which I 
realized wasn’t the best choice for the reader. </p>
      
<p>The third step in paraphrasing is changing the structure of the original sentence.  Now, 
this isn’t always easy, nor is it always necessary.  However, you should try it.  I first try to 
flip the sentence around, rearranging any prepositional or participle phrases.  Here is 
what I ended up with.  </p>

<p>Most planes at this time had only two engines, but the B17, streamlined and 
striking, featured an almost 60 yard wingspan and a quartet of Boeing 
engines.</p>
  
<p>As you can see, I took the last part about how most planes had only two engines from 
the back of the sentence and put it at the front--very simple.   From here, I can add an 
“although” to the beginning of the sentence and get rid of the “but” from the middle.  So, 
now my final sentence ends up as. </p>

<p>Although most planes at this time had only two engines, the B17, 
streamlined and striking, featured an almost 60 yard wingspan and a 
quartet of Boeing engines.</p>

<p>To check my sentence, I do one final thing.  I copy and paste it into a Google search to 
see if the New Yorker article shows up in the first page, and it doesn’t.  There are also 
other plagiarism checkers that you can use, such as Quetext at 
https://www.quetext.com/, but I have found that Google works quite well, and you 
don’t have to sign up for it. </p>
<p>So, that’s how you paraphrase a sentence.  It really isn’t that hard, and once you get the 
hang of it, you will no longer need the thesaurus. </p>
<br>
      Practice Paraphrasing these sentences. <br>
1.	Change the words<br>
2.	Keep the meaning<br>
3.	Change the structure<br>
4.	Add a concession if possible <br>

<p>Writing the Introduction
Where do I begin?  Writing your introduction.   
Start with a question. 
What are logical fallacies and why are they important? 
Answer the question.   
Turn the topic around 
The opposite of logical is irrational. 
Start with the irrational and then turn it around. 
Brainstorm  
What are some synonyms of logic? 
Rational

<br>
Broad to Narrow <br>
<br>
<p>Logical fallacies are used by almost everyone.  They are easy to use because they require 
no facts or evidence.   They are very often used on Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube by 
politicians, advertisers, and conspiracy theorists.  We kind of expect them from 
politicians and conspiracy theorists, but we should never see them used in healthcare.  
Used in healthcare, they can cause you to waste your money, injury, and even death.  In 
healthcare, appeal to emotion, burden of proof, and false cause are probably the three 
most commonly used logical fallacies.</p>  
 
<p>Narrow to Broad 
In the movie, Thank You for Smoking, Aron Eckart’s character turns an argument about 
which flavor of ice cream, chocolate or vanilla, is better, into an argument about liberty 
and freedom.  This is a strawman fallacy, and it occurs when someone misdirects a 
debate about one thing, such as which type of ice cream is better into something else.  
This allows the arguer to avoid having to deal with the actual topic that is being 
discussed.  This is a popular fallacy for politicians to use. </p>  

<p>Quotation 
According to the professional skeptic Christopher Hitchens, “That which can be asserted 
without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.”  Mr Hitchens believed that 
modern society was born on the concept that people need to prove their assertion before 
we should believe them.  This belief is ingrained in our justice system: innocent until 
proven guilty.  And the scientific method whereby controlled experiments prove that 
which has been asserted or theorized.  Burden of proof... 
Some other authors and scientists who would provide excellent quotes. 
Michael Shermer 
Richard Dawkins 
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  
Harry Houdini 
Albert Einstein 
Voltaire 
Socrates   </p>

<p>Anecdotal 
When I was a child, my parents often told us about Santa Claus who was an old 
overweight white guy who watched children as they slept and that if we weren’t good we 
wouldn’t get any presents on Christmas.  Of course, eventually children begin to realize 
that Santa couldn’t possibly fit through the chimney or that he couldn’t possibly deliver 
presents to every child in the world within 24 hours.  However, parents </p>

<p>Contrasting Ideas 
Currently at Blackhawk Technical College students are required to take a Student 
Success course.  The book from this course offers students a questionnaire that helps 
them to determine their learning style preference.  The problem with this is that 
learning styles have no basis in science.  They are what we call confirmation bias, 
meaning that they sound like they are a good idea.  After I graduate from the school of 
education, I will only use methods of teaching that are scientifically valid.   </p>

<p>Starting with questions 

What is a logical fallacy?  Logical fallacies are….    
Why are logical fallacies important to know?  Logical fallacies are important to know 
because… </p>

Supporting Paragraph 

<p>An ad hominem fallacy is often referred to as name calling.  Ad hominems are when 
people attack the person making the argument with irrelevant name calling.  For 
example, claiming that a woman doesn’t know anything about fixing a car because she is 
a woman, is an ad hominem attack because being a woman has nothing to do with being 
able to fix a car.  These are popular because people often believe the name calling when 
the person being attacked doesn’t respond to the name calling.   However, pointing out 
that someone is arguing from ignorance is not an ad-hominem attack because ignorance 
or the lack of knowledge, facts or evidence is relevant to the discussion.  </p>

<p>The best way to structure a supporting paragraph is to start with a topic sentence that is 
much like the thesis statement you read about earlier.  The topic sentence should be a 
single sentence that summarizes or makes a statement about what the paragraph will be 
presenting.  It’s often best to start with a vague topic sentence and then make it more 
specific after you write your paragraph.  For example, let’s say I am going to write about 
the logical fallacy known as an appeal to emotion.  I might start my paragraph with a 
statement like, “Appeals to emotion are common.”  Then, I will start writing.  After my 
topic sentence, I will want to provide a definition of what an appeal to emotion is.  Then, 
I will want to provide a real-world example, such as the Cheerios commercial “Breakfast 
with Nana.”  You don’t want to use a made-up example like those you find at logical 
fallacy websites because they don’t help the reader apply them in real life.  You want to 
use real examples of appeals to emotion, so that the reader can see the context that they 
are used in.  After you have your example, you’ll want to explain how it is an appeal to 
emotion.  For example, in Breakfast with Nana, a little girl asks her mom if Cheerios is 
the same when she was a little girl.  The mom responds with a yes, it was the same.  To 
that the little girl replies, “So when we have Cheerios, it’s like we’re having breakfast 
with Nana.”  A tear then forms in Mom’s eye because grandma has obviously passed 
away.  Leveraging the death of a grandparent to sell some cereal is an obvious appeal to 
emotion.  So here is the structure of a supporting paragraph in the case of a logical 
fallacy like an appeal to emotion.  </p>
1.	Topic sentence.
2.	Definition of appeal to emotion
3.	Real world example of an appeal to emotion
4.	Explanation of the example

Descriptive Essay
<p>	The important parts of the descriptive essay are the descriptions.  There are some 
important elements to writing good descriptions.  First, the use of concrete nouns to 
support or replace abstract nouns.  For example, students will say something like this: 
“The mountains are beautiful,” and then repeat that in as many different ways they can 
for the rest of the paragraph.  This doesn’t really show the reader how the mountains are 
beautiful, it just tells you that they are.  You can start with the abstraction of beauty but 
then provide concrete examples of that beauty.  The mountains are beautiful could 
become, “The mountains are beautiful.  In the late morning, the sun spills over the 
valleys and then peaks like an inverted waterfall of light and color.  Darkness gives way 
to a forest that puffs green blossoms in thousands of shades of greens: lime greens, pine 
greens, forest greens, fern greens, moss green, and sap green while a shroud of heavenly 
mist slowly evaporates away.”  See the difference?   </p>
 
<p>The easiest descriptive essay is to write about something that you know.   I know where I 
grew up well, so I am going to describe that.  I grew up in the small town of Dousman, 
Wisconsin.  </p>

Introduction
     <p> I was born in Milwaukee, and up until I was four, we lived on 96th Street next to 
Alcott Park in Greenfield which is a South-West-side Suburb of Milwaukee.  From there 
we moved to the small town of Dousman, WI.  Back then, there were only 500 people 
living in Dousman, and we lived off a gravel-tar Parry Road on what was once a 
cornfield.  You could tell because the tilled mounds were still there under the grass. In 
was the 1970s, and we didn’t have cable tv, computers, or the Internet.  There wasn’t a 
movie theatre or even a restaurant nearby.   What we did have was a five acre yard.  </p>
<p>	In the front yard, we had a home-made baseball diamond.  We used some slabs of 
limestone for the bases, trying to make sure the running line didn’t encounter any 
gopher holes or thistles.  The pitcher’s mound wasn’t really a mound.  I was just a two-
by-four that we stomped into the sandy soil.  Scattered throughout the yard were 
scraggly bushy ten foot tall cedar trees with their prickly green needles and alien like 
seeds that were purple and orange that we used as defensive outfielders.  If you hit the 
ball into a tree, and not through it, you were out.  Not only that, but then it was your job 
to endure the prickly needles, spider webs, or wasps’ nests and dig it out.  If you hit the 
ball over the road, over the barbed wire fence, and into the grass field with scattered 20 
foot fir trees across the street, it was a home run.   If it rolled across the road or landed 
on it, it was a triple and anywhere else was a double.  </p>  
	<p>In the back yard there was a vegetable garden and a fort.  The vegetable garden 
was about an acre in size.  It had all the good stuff: asparagus that came up every year, 
tomato vines that produced large red juicy beefy tomatoes, green cucumbers that we 
picked when immature for pickling, and melons—water and musk.  With vegetables are 
the honey bees and bumble bees, buzzing around your ear, dodging around while you’re 
trying to pull weeds, and not get stung.  Next to the garden, where we stored wood for 
the winter was Fort Kick-ass.  Long logs of oak and hickory piled in a criss-cross pattern 
so they wouldn’t roll off made up the outer walls.  Inside, we tied three small dogwood 
trees we had cut down at the top, </p> 


<h4>Christmas by Brianna Nightengale</h4>
<p>My home during the holiday season is a scene out of a Better Homes and Garden magazine. The beautiful decorations engulf the yellow sided and beige brick ranch style house. Dinner cooking in the kitchen emanates through the foggy windows and into the freshly shoveled driveway. The flat stone covered fireplace calls to you as you can see it through the semi frosted front windows from the recently plowed street.</p>
<p>Yuletide decorations catch your eye from the quiet sloped street. Twinkling lights line the snow-covered roof with icicles forming from it. The illuminated large gold star hanging in-between the two white trimmed picture windows draws you in. There is a white pine decorated with red, green, blue, yellow, and white lights and frosted garland speckled with cranberries on the open front porch. A festive glittery wreath hangs on the cold metal blue door. Inside, the light hued pine wood floors creak with every step. A Douglas fir greets you with its sweet pine aroma. Its soft green-blue needles tickle your chilled skin as you walk by. The silver tinsel glittering in the firelight calms your soul. Green and red bulbs reflect your gaze. A modest white glowing star tops it off. Under the tree is a bountiful pile of flashy gifts sitting upon a red plaid tree skirt. The different patterned wrapping paper, looped ribbons, and stuffed bags topped with multi colored tissue paper fill your eyes with wonder. In the corner, a fragile figurine town celebrates its own winter wonderland, sitting atop an oval antique wooden table. A red poinsettia printed table cloth covers the ancient English chestnut stained dining table as it waits to hold our meal. Ivory ceramic dinner plates section every seat. Silverware sitting upon a forest green cloth napkin shines under the soft glow of the upplight chandelier. Six creaky brown mahogany wooden chairs surround the old-fashioned table. </p>
<p>Before entering the warm house, the fragrant holiday meal embraces you in the driveway which carries you up the pathway to the exposed porch with the front door. Honey ham baked with brown sugar and pineapple juice saturates the entire residence. Buttery mashed potatoes flavored with garlic accompanies the meat. A glass dish of browned cornbread casserole cools atop the cream tinted counter alongside a pale blue ceramic bowl filled with bright green asparagus seasoned with a touch of salt and butter. There is a rectangle clear plastic container filled with cut out cookies in the shape of trees, santas, and stars to fulfill your sweet tooth. The homemade icing covers the roll out cookies and is topped with a pinch of colored sugar sprinkles. Warm spiced apple pie with a flaky, buttery golden-brown crust waits patiently for us to dig in.</p>
<p>From the street you can see the large stone fireplace in the center of my home through the snowy windows. The scent of burning wood fills the frigid winter air. You hear something calling you, it’s the popping and crackling from burning the maple tree firewood caressing your eardrums. Red and white Christmas stockings with a cartoon bear and our names written on them in glittery glue anticipating Santa’s arrival to fill them, are pinned up along the white painted intricately carved mantel. The fire warms the light-colored grey stone to where you can still feel the heat on the backside of it the next morning. Grey ash from smoldering embers litter the built-in stone bench. Black soot delicately discolors the vulnerable stones above the gold metal trimmed opening.</p>
<p>The place where I grew up, my humble abode, is astonishing and calming during the holiday season. Forget your bothersome troubles and relax. The inviting colorful Christmas decorations, fresh and homemade delicious food, and the warm huge fireplace welcomes everyone, no invite required.</p>





 
Writing Conventions
      Writing conventions refers to the rules of writing, such as the proper use of 
grammar, punctuation, and mechanics.  These rules are important because they help 
prevent the reader from being confused.  There are also legal and monetary matters to 
consider.  For example, the AT&T Yellow Pages once misspelled the word “exotic,” 
replacing it with “erotic” in a travel agency advertisement.  The lawsuit that followed 
cost AT&T $10 million.  In an article by the BBC, they estimate spelling mistakes cost 
online sellers millions of dollars in lost income each year (Coughlan, 2011) .   The 
problem is that mistakes erode the credibility of the writer and credibility is important 
to employers and customers.
      
      What is a sentence?
      A sentence is a complete thought that contains a subject and a verb, which can be 
implied.  For example, let’s say you ask a rhetorical question like this one from Stephen 
Colbert’s book, I Am America (And So Can You!).  
      “Well, like a lot of other dictators, there is one man's opinion I value above 
all others. Mine.”  
      You will notice that the second sentence contains only one word—mine.  In 
this sentence, both the subject and the verb are implied.  The implied subject is 
“it” and the implied verb is “is.”  “It” refers to “one man’s opinion.”  So, if you 
wrote the sentence out completely it would be, “It is mine.”  However, in speech, 
we often just shorten these sentences to save time.  Sentences that have implied 
subjects and verbs can never be the first sentence in a paragraph.  You’ll notice 
that without the information from the previous sentence, the “Mine,” sentence 
wouldn’t make sense. 
      
      
      
      Punctuation by Function
      
      Lot’s of people have problems with punctuation because too often the rules 
are left out of context with how they are used together, so I want to show you how 
to build sentences with punctuation.  Let’s start with the most common way of 
using punctuation: making lists.  We don’t start using commas with lists until we 
have three or more items.  Here is an example of a list using a colon to start the 
list and, of course, commas to separate the items in the list from the New Yorker.  
The damage that the human body can survive these days is as awesome 
as it is horrible: crushing, burning, bombing, a burst blood vessel in the 
brain, a ruptured colon, a massive heart attack, rampaging infection. 
(Gawande, 2007)
In this example, the list starts at the end of a complete sentence.  It has seven 
items, you’ll notice that the last item doesn’t have an “and” before it.  You could 
also write that same sentence using dashes and moving it to the middle of the 
sentence.  
The damage that the human body can survive—crushing, burning, 
bombing, a burst blood vessel in the brain, a ruptured colon, a massive 
heart attack, rampaging infection—is as awesome as it is horrible. 
(Gawande, 2007)
The colon and dash act similarly.  The dash is a bit more versatile because it can 
be used to put lists almost anywhere in the sentence.  You should notice that 
there isn’t a space between the dash and the words around it.  Now you should 
know that there isn’t a dash key on your keyboard.  In MS Word, you simply use 
two hyphens and Word will replace them with a dash.  Here is another list from 
the same New Yorker article.
Typically, this involves a panoply of technology—a mechanical ventilator 
and perhaps a tracheostomy tube if the lungs have failed, an aortic 
balloon pump if the heart has given out, a dialysis machine if the kidneys 
don’t work. (Gawande, 2007)
In this case, we use a dash to start the list because our list isn’t a formal list.  The 
items have subordinate clauses in them: they start with “if.” 



THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN A NUTSHELL
All the words in the English language are divided into nine great classes. These 
classes are called the Parts of Speech. They are Article, Noun, Adjective, Pronoun, 
Verb, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction and Interjection. Of these, the Noun is the 
most important, as all the others are dependent upon it. A Noun signifies the name of 
any person, place or thing, in fact, anything of which we can have either thought or 
idea. There are two kinds of Nouns, Proper and Common. Common Nouns are names 
which belong in common to things, places, and people, such as man, city. Proper 
Nouns distinguish individual and unique things, people, and places, such 
as John, Philadelphia. In the former case man is a name which belongs in common to 
the whole of mankind, and city is also a name which is common to all large centers of 
population, but John signifies an individual, while Philadelphia denotes a particular 
one from among the cities of the world.
Nouns are varied by person, number, gender, and case. Person is that relation existing 
between the speaker, those addressed and the subject under consideration, whether by 
discourse or correspondence. The Persons are First, Second and Third and they 
represent respectively the speaker, the person addressed, and the person or thing 
mentioned or under consideration.
Number is the distinction of one from more than one. There are two numbers, singular 
and plural; the singular denotes one, the plural two or more. The plural is generally 
formed from the singular by the addition of s or es.
Gender has the same relation to nouns that sex has to individuals, but while there are 
only two sexes, there are four genders, viz., masculine, feminine, neuter and common. 
The masculine gender denotes all those of the male kind, the feminine gender all those 
of the female kind, the neuter gender denotes inanimate things or whatever is without 
life, and common gender is applied to animate beings, the sex of which for the time 
being is indeterminable, such as fish, mouse, bird, etc. Sometimes things which are 
without life as we conceive it and which, properly speaking, belong to the neuter 
gender, are, by a figure of speech called personification, changed into either the 
masculine or feminine gender, as, for instance, we say of the sun, He is rising; of the 
moon, She is setting.
Case is the relation one noun bears to another or to a verb or to a preposition. There 
are three cases, the Nominative, the Possessive and the Objective. The nominative is 
the subject of which we are speaking or the agent which directs the action of the verb; 
the possessive case denotes possession, while the objective indicates the person or 
thing which is affected by the action of the verb.
An Article is a word placed before a noun to show whether the latter is used in a 
particular or general sense. There are but two articles, a or an and the.
An Adjective is a word which qualifies a noun, that is, which shows some 
distinguishing mark or characteristic belonging to the noun.
DEFINITIONS
A Pronoun is a word used for or instead of a noun to keep us from repeating the same 
noun too often. Pronouns, like nouns, have case, number, gender and person. There 
are three kinds of pronouns, personal, relative and adjective.
A verb is a word which signifies action or the doing of something. A verb is inflected 
by tense and mood and by number and person, though the latter two belong strictly to 
the subject of the verb.
An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective and sometimes another 
adverb.
A preposition serves to connect words and to show the relation between the objects 
which the words express.
A conjunction is a word which joins words, phrases, clauses and sentences together.
An interjection is a word which expresses surprise or some sudden emotion of the 
mind.
THE PARTS OF SPEECH
ARTICLE
An Article is a word placed before a noun to show whether the noun is used in a 
particular or general sense.
There are two articles, a or an and the. A or an is called the indefinite article because 
it does not point to any particular person or thing but indicates the noun in its widest 
sense; thus, a woman means any woman.
The is called the definite article because it points out some specific person or thing; 
thus, the man means some particular individual.
NOUN
A noun is the name of any person, place, idea, or thing as John, London, book, 
kindness. Nouns are proper and common.
Proper nouns are names applied to particular persons or places.
Common nouns are names applied to a whole kind or species.
Nouns are inflected by number, gender, and case.
Number is that inflection of the noun by which we indicate whether it represents one 
or more than one.
Gender is that inflection by which we signify whether the noun is the name of a male, 
a female, of an inanimate object or something which has no distinction of sex.
Case is that inflection of the noun which denotes the state of the person, place or thing 
represented, as the subject of an affirmation or question, the owner or possessor of 
something mentioned, or the object of an action or of a relation.
Thus in the example, "John tore the leaves of Sarah's book," the distinction 
between book which represents only one object and leaves which represent two or 
more objects of the same kind is called Number; the distinction of sex between John, a 
male, and Sarah, a female, and book and leaves, things which are inanimate and 
neither male nor female, is called Gender; and the distinction of state between John, 
the person who tore the book, and the subject of the affirmation, Mary, the owner of 
the book, leaves the objects torn, and book the object related to leaves, as the whole of 
which they were a part, is called Case.
ADJECTIVE
An adjective is a word which qualifies a noun, that is, shows or points out some 
distinguishing mark or feature of the noun; as, A black dog.
Adjectives have three forms called degrees of comparison, the positive, 
the comparative and the superlative.
The positive is the simple form of the adjective without expressing increase or 
diminution of the original quality: nice.
The comparative is that form of the adjective which expresses increase or diminution 
of the quality: nicer.
The superlative is that form which expresses the greatest increase or diminution of the 
quality: nicest.
or
An adjective is in the positive form when it does not express comparison; as, 
"A rich man."
An adjective is in the comparative form when it expresses comparison between two or 
between one and a number taken collectively, as, "John is richer than James"; "he 
is richer than all the men in Boston."
An adjective is in the superlative form when it expresses a comparison between one 
and several individuals taken separately; as, "John is the richest man in Boston."
Adjectives expressive of properties or circumstances which cannot be increased have 
only the positive form; as, A circular road; the chief end; an extreme measure.
Adjectives are compared in two ways, either by adding er to the positive to form the 
comparative and est to the positive to form the superlative, or by prefixing more to the 
positive for the comparative and most to the positive for the superlative; 
as, handsome, handsomer, handsomest or handsome, more handsome, most 
handsome.
Adjectives of two or more syllables are generally compared by prefixing more and 
most.
Many adjectives are irregular in comparison; as, Bad, worse, worst; Good, better, best.
PRONOUN
A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun; as, "John gave his pen to James 
and he lent it to Jane to write her copy with it." Without the pronouns we would have 
to write this sentence,—"John gave John's pen to James and James lent the pen to Jane 
to write Jane's copy with the pen."
There are three kinds of pronouns—Personal, Relative and Adjective Pronouns.
Personal Pronouns are so called because they are used instead of the names of 
persons, places and things. The Personal Pronouns are I, Thou, He, She, and It, with 
their plurals, We, Ye or You and They.
I is the pronoun of the first person because it represents the person speaking.
You is the pronoun of the second person because it represents the person spoken to.
He, She, It are the pronouns of the third person because they represent the persons or 
things of whom we are speaking.
Like nouns, the Personal Pronouns have number, gender and case. The gender of the 
first and second person is obvious, as they represent the person or persons speaking 
and those who are addressed. The personal pronouns are thus declined:


First Person. 
M. or F.

Sing.
Plural.
N.
I
We
P.
Mine
Ours
O.
Me
Us
Second Person. 
M. or F.

Theirs
O.
Her
Them
Third Person. 
Neuter.

Sing.
Plural.
N.
It
They
P.
Its
Theirs
O.
It
Them
The Relative Pronouns are so called because they relate to some word or phrase going 
before; as, "The boy who told the truth;" "He has done well, which gives me great 
pleasure."
Here who and which are not only used in place of other words, but who refers 
immediately to boy, and which to the circumstance of his having done well.
The word or clause to which a relative pronoun refers is called the Antecedent.
The Relative Pronouns are who, which, that and what.
Who is applied to persons only; as, "The man who was here."
Which is applied to the lower animals and things without life; as, "The horse which I 
sold." "The hat which I bought."
That is applied to both persons and things; as, "The friend that helps." "The 
bird that sings." "The knife that cuts."
What is a compound relative, including both the antecedent and the relative and is 
equivalent to that which; as, "I did what he desired," i. e. "I did that which he desired."
Relative pronouns have the singular and plural alike.
Who is either masculine or feminine; which and that are masculine, feminine or 
neuter; what as a relative pronoun is always neuter.
That and what are not inflected.
Who and which are thus declined:
Sing. and Plural

Sing. and Plural
N.
Who

N.
Which
P.
Whose

P.
Whose
O.
Whom

O.
Which
Who, which and what when used to ask questions are called Interrogative Pronouns.
Adjective Pronouns partake of the nature of adjectives and pronouns and are 
subdivided as follows:
Demonstrative Adjective Pronouns which directly point out the person or object. They 
are this, that with their plurals these, those, and yon, same and selfsame.
Distributive Adjective Pronouns used distributively. They 
are each, every, either, neither.
Indefinite Adjective Pronouns used more or less indefinitely. They 
are any, all, few, some, several, one, other, another, none.
Possessive Adjective Pronouns denoting possession. They 
are my, thy, his, her, its, our, your, their.
N. B.—(The possessive adjective pronouns differ from the possessive case of the 
personal pronouns in that the latter can stand alone while the former cannot. "Who 
owns that book?" "It is mine." You cannot say "it is my,"—the word book must be 
repeated.)
THE VERB
A verb is a word which implies action or the doing of something, or it may be defined 
as a word which affirms, commands or asks a question.
Thus, the words John the table, contain no assertion, but when the word strikes is 
introduced, something is affirmed, hence the word strikes is a verb and gives 
completeness and meaning to the group.
The simple form of the verb without inflection is called the root of the verb; e. g. 
love is the root of the verb,—"To Love."
Verbs are regular or irregular, transitive or intransitive.
A verb is said to be regular when it forms the past tense by adding ed to the present 
or d if the verb ends in e. When its past tense does not end in ed it is said to 
be irregular.
A transitive verb is one the action of which passes over to or affects some object; as "I 
struck the table." Here the action of striking affected the object table, hence struck is a 
transitive verb.
An intransitive verb is one in which the action remains with the subject; as "I 
walk," "I sit," "I run."
Many intransitive verbs, however, can be used transitively; thus, "I walk the 
horse;" walk is here transitive.
Verbs are inflected by number, person, tense and mood.
Number and person as applied to the verb really belong to the subject; they are used 
with the verb to denote whether the assertion is made regarding one or more than one 
and whether it is made in reference to the person speaking, the person spoken to or the 
person or thing spoken about.
TENSE
In their tenses verbs follow the divisions of time. They have present tense, past 
tense and future tense with their variations to express the exact time of action as to an 
event happening, having happened or yet to happen.
MOOD
There are four simple moods,—the Infinitive, the Indicative, the Imperative and 
the Subjunctive.
The Mood of a verb denotes the mode or manner in which it is used. Thus if it is used 
in its widest sense without reference to person or number, time or place, it is in 
the Infinitive Mood; as "To run." Here we are not told who does the running, when it 
is done, where it is done or anything about it.
When a verb is used to indicate or declare or ask a simple question or make any direct 
statement, it is in the Indicative Mood. "The boy loves his book." Here a direct 
statement is made concerning the boy. "Have you a pin?" Here a simple question is 
asked which calls for an answer.
When the verb is used to express a command or entreaty it is in the Imperative Mood 
as, "Go away." "Give me a penny."
When the verb is used to express doubt, supposition or uncertainty or when some 
future action depends upon a contingency, it is in the subjunctive mood; as, "If I 
come, he shall remain."
Many grammarians include a fifth mood called the potential to 
express power, possibility, liberty, necessity, will or duty. It is formed by means of the 
auxiliaries may, can, ought and must, but in all cases it can be resolved into the 
indicative or subjunctive. Thus, in "I may write if I choose," "may write" is by some 
classified as in the potential mood, but in reality the phrase I may write is an 
indicative one while the second clause, if I choose, is the expression of a condition 
upon which, not my liberty to write, depends, but my actual writing.
Verbs have two participles, the present or imperfect, sometimes called 
the active ending in ing and the past or perfect, often called the passive, ending 
in ed or d.
The infinitive expresses the sense of the verb in a substantive form, the participles in 
an adjective form; as "To rise early is healthful." "An early rising man." "The newly 
risen sun."
The participle in ing is frequently used as a substantive and consequently is equivalent 
to an infinitive; thus, "To rise early is healthful" and "Rising early is healthful" are the 
same.
The principal parts of a verb are the Present Indicative, Past Indicative and Past 
Participle; as:
Love
Loved
Loved
Sometimes one or more of these parts are wanting, and then the verb is said to be 
defective.
Present
Past
Passive Participle
Can
Could
(Wanting)
May
Might
"
Shall
Should
"
Will
Would
"
Ought
Ought
"
Verbs may also be divided into principal and auxiliary. A principal verb is that 
without which a sentence or clause can contain no assertion or affirmation. 
An auxiliary is a verb joined to the root or participles of a principal verb to express 
time and manner with greater precision than can be done by the tenses and moods in 
their simple form. Thus, the sentence, "I am writing an exercise; when I shall have 
finished it I shall read it to the class." has no meaning without the principal 
verbs writing, finished read; but the meaning is rendered more definite, especially 
with regard to time, by the auxiliary verbs am, have, shall.
There are nine auxiliary or helping verbs, 
viz., Be, have, do, shall, will, may, can, ought, and must. They are called helping 
verbs, because it is by their aid the compound tenses are formed.
TO BE
The verb To Be is the most important of the auxiliary verbs. It has eleven parts, 
viz., am, is, are, was, were; be, being and been.
VOICE
The active voice is that form of the verb which shows the Subject not being acted 
upon but acting; as, "The cat catches mice." "Charity covers a multitude of sins."
The passive voice: When the action signified by a transitive verb is thrown back upon 
the agent, that is to say, when the subject of the verb denotes the recipient of the 
action, the verb is said to be in the passive voice. "John was loved by his neighbors." 
Here John the subject is also the object affected by the loving, the action of the verb is 
thrown back on him, hence the compound verb was loved is said to be in the passive 
voice. The passive voice is formed by putting the perfect participle of 
any transitive verb with any of the eleven parts of the verb To Be.
CONJUGATION
The conjugation of a verb is its orderly arrangement in voices, moods, tenses, persons 
and numbers.
Here is the complete conjugation of the verb "Love"—Active Voice.

ADVERB
An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb. Thus, in 
the example—"He writes well," the adverb shows the manner in which the writing is 
performed; in the examples—"He is remarkably diligent," and "He works very 
faithfully," the adverbs modify the adjective diligent and the other adverb faithfully by 
expressing the degree of diligence and faithfulness.
Adverbs are chiefly used to express in one word what would otherwise require two or 
more words; thus, There signifies in that place;  usefully, in a useful manner.
Adverbs, like adjectives, are sometimes varied in their terminations to express 
comparison and different degrees of quality.
Some adverbs form the comparative and superlative by adding er and est; 
as, soon, sooner, soonest.
Adverbs which end in ly are compared by prefixing more and most; as, nobly, more 
nobly, most nobly.
A few adverbs are irregular in the formation of the comparative and superlative; 
as, well, better, best.
PREPOSITION
A preposition connects words, clauses, and sentences together and shows the relation 
between them. "My hand is on the table" shows relation between hand and table.
Prepositions are so called because they are generally placed before the words whose 
connection or relation with other words they point out.
CONJUNCTION
A conjunction joins words, clauses and sentences; as "John and James." "My father 
and mother have come, but I have not seen them."
The conjunctions in most general use are and, also; either, or; neither, nor; though, 
yet; but, however; for, that; because, since; therefore, wherefore, then; if, unless, lest.


INTERJECTION
An interjection is a word used to express some sudden emotion of the mind. Thus in 
the examples,—"Ah! there he comes; alas! what shall I do?" ah, expresses surprise, 
and alas, distress.
Nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs become interjections when they are uttered as 
exclamations, as, nonsense! strange! hail! away! etc.
We have now enumerated the parts of speech and as briefly as possible stated the 
functions of each. As they all belong to the same family they are related to one 
another but some are in closer affinity than others. To point out the exact relationship 
and the dependency of one word on another is called parsing and in order that every 
etymological connection may be distinctly understood a brief resume of the foregoing 
essentials is here given:
The signification of the noun is limited to one, but to any one of the kind, by 
the indefinite article, and to some particular one, or some particular number, by 
the definite article.
Nouns, in one form, represent one of a kind, and in another, any number more than 
one; they are the names of males, or females, or of objects which are neither male nor 
female; and they represent the subject of an affirmation, a command or a question,—
the owner or possessor of a thing,—or the object of an action, or of a relation 
expressed by a preposition.
Adjectives express the qualities which distinguish one person or thing from another; in 
one form they express quality without comparison; in another, they express 
comparison between two, or between one and a number taken collectively—and in a 
third they express comparison between one and several others taken separately.
Pronouns are used in place of nouns; one class of them is used merely as 
the substitutes of names; the pronouns of another class have a peculiar reference to 
some preceding words in the sentence, of which they are the substitutes—and those of 
a third class refer adjectively to the persons or things they represent. Some pronouns 
are used for both the name and the substitute; and several are frequently employed 
in asking questions.
Affirmations and commands are expressed by the verb; and different inflections of the 
verb express number, person, time and manner. With regard to time, an affirmation 
may be present or past or future; with regard to manner, an affirmation may 
be positive or conditional, it being doubtful whether the condition is fulfilled or not, or 
it being implied that it is not fulfilled;—the verb may express command or entreaty; or 
the sense of the verb may be expressed without affirming or commanding. The verb 
also expresses that an action or state is or was going on, by a form which is also used 
sometimes as a noun, and sometimes to qualify nouns.
Affirmations are modified by adverbs, some of which can be inflected to express 
different degrees of modification.
Words are joined together by conjunctions; and the various relations which one thing 
bears to another are expressed by 'prepositions. Sudden emotions of the mind, 
and exclamations are expressed by interjections.
Some words according to meaning belong sometimes to one part of speech, 
sometimes to another. Thus, in "After a storm comes a calm," calm is a noun; in "It is 
a calm evening," calm is an adjective; and in "Calm your fears," calm is a verb.
The following sentence containing all the parts of speech is parsed etymologically:
"I now see the old man coming, but, alas, he has walked with much difficulty."
I, a personal pronoun, first person singular, masculine or feminine gender, nominative 
case, subject of the verb see.
now, an adverb of time modifying the verb see.
see, an irregular, transitive verb, indicative mood, present tense, first person singular 
to agree with its nominative or subject I.
the, the definite article particularizing the noun man.
old, an adjective, positive degree, qualifying the noun man.
man, a common noun, 3rd person singular, masculine gender, objective case governed 
by the transitive verb see.
coming, the present or imperfect participle of the verb "to come" referring to the noun 
man.
but, a conjunction.
alas, an interjection, expressing pity or sorrow.
he, a personal pronoun, 3rd person singular, masculine gender, nominative case, 
subject of verb has walked.
has walked, a regular, intransitive verb, indicative mood, perfect tense, 3rd person 
singular to agree with its nominative or subject he.
with, a preposition, governing the noun difficulty.

THE SENTENCE
Different Kinds—Arrangement of Words—Paragraph
A sentence is an assemblage of words so arranged as to convey a determinate sense or 
meaning, in other words, to express a complete thought or idea. No matter how short, 
it must contain one finite verb and a subject or agent to direct the action of the verb.
"Birds fly;" "Fish swim;" "Men walk;"—are sentences.
A sentence always contains two parts, something spoken about and something said 
about it. The word or words indicating what is spoken about form what is called 
the subject and the word or words indicating what is said about it, form what is called 
the predicate.
In the sentences given, birds, fish and men are the subjects, 
while fly, swim and walk are the predicates.
There are three kinds of sentences, simple, compound and complex.
The simple sentence expresses a single thought and consists of one subject and one 
predicate, as, "Man is mortal."
A compound sentence consists of two or more simple sentences of equal importance 
the parts of which are either expressed or understood, as, "The men work in the fields 
and the women work in the household," or "The men work in the fields and the 
women in the household" or "The men and women work in the fields and in the 
household."
A complex sentence consists of two or more simple sentences so combined that one 
depends on the other to complete its meaning; as; "When he returns, I shall go on my 
vacation." Here the words, "when he returns" are dependent on the rest of the sentence 
for their meaning.
A clause is a separate part of a complex sentence, as "when he returns" in the last 
example.
A phrase consists of two or more words without a finite verb.
Without a finite verb we cannot affirm anything or convey an idea, therefore we can 
have no sentence.
Infinitives and participles which are the infinite parts of the verb cannot be predicates. 
"I looking up the street" is not a sentence, for it is not a complete action expressed. 
When we hear such an expression as "A dog running along the street," we wait for 
something more to be added, something more affirmed about the dog, whether he bit 
or barked or fell dead or was run over.
Thus, in every sentence there must be a finite verb to limit the subject.
When the verb is transitive, that is, when the action cannot happen without affecting 
something, the thing affected is called the object.
Thus in "Cain killed Abel" the action of the killing affected Abel. In "The cat has 
caught a mouse," mouse is the object of the catching.
ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE
Of course, in simple sentences the natural order of arrangement is subject—verb—
object. In many cases no other form is possible. Thus in the sentence "The cat has 
caught a mouse," we cannot reverse it and say "The mouse has caught a cat" without 
destroying the meaning, and in any other form of arrangement, such as "A mouse, the 
cat has caught," we feel that while it is intelligible, it is a poor way of expressing the 
fact and one which jars upon us more or less.
In longer sentences, however, when there are more words than what are barely 
necessary for subject, verb and object, we have greater freedom of arrangement and 
can so place the words as to give the best effect. The proper placing of words depends 
upon perspicuity and precision. These two combined give style to the structure.
Most people are familiar with Gray's line in the immortal Elegy—"The ploughman 
homeward plods his weary way." This line can be paraphrased to read 18 different 
ways. Here are a few variations:
      Homeward the ploughman plods his weary way.
      The ploughman plods his weary way homeward.
      Plods homeward the ploughman his weary way.
      His weary way the ploughman homeward plods.
      Homeward his weary way plods the ploughman.
      Plods the ploughman his weary way homeward.
      His weary way the ploughman plods homeward.
      His weary way homeward the ploughman plods.
      The ploughman plods homeward his weary way.
      The ploughman his weary way plods homeward.
and so on. It is doubtful if any of the other forms are superior to the one used by the 
poet. Of course, his arrangement was made to comply with the rhythm and rhyme of 
the verse. Most of the variations depend upon the emphasis we wish to place upon the 
different words.
In arranging the words in an ordinary sentence, we should not lose sight of the fact 
that the beginning and end are the important places for catching the attention of the 
reader. Words in these places have greater emphasis than elsewhere.
In Gray's line the general meaning conveyed is that a weary ploughman is plodding 
his way homeward, but according to the arrangement a very slight difference is 
affected in the idea. Some of the variations make us think more of the ploughman, 
others more of the plodding, and still others more of the weariness.
As the beginning and end of a sentence are the most important places, it naturally 
follows that small or insignificant words should be kept from these positions. Of the 
two places the end one is the more important, therefore, it really calls for the most 
important word in the sentence. Never commence a sentence 
with And, But, Since, Because, and other similar weak words and never end it with 
prepositions, small, weak adverbs or pronouns.
The parts of a sentence which are most closely connected with one another in meaning 
should be closely connected in order also. By ignoring this principle many sentences 
are made, if not nonsensical, really ridiculous and ludicrous. For instance: "Ten 
dollars reward is offered for information of any person injuring this property by order 
of the owner." "This monument was erected to the memory of John Jones, who was 
shot by his affectionate brother."
In the construction of all sentences the grammatical rules must be inviolably observed. 
The laws of concord, that is, the agreement of certain words, must be obeyed.
1.	The verb agrees with its subject in person and number. "I have," "He has," 
show the variation of the verb to agree with the subject. A singular subject calls 
for a singular verb, a plural subject demands a verb in the plural; as, "The boy 
writes," "The boys write."
The agreement of a verb and its subject is often destroyed by confusing (1) 
collective and common nouns; (2) foreign and English nouns; (3) compound 
and simple subjects; (4) real and apparent subjects.
(1) A collective noun is a number of individuals or things regarded as a whole; as, class 
regiment. When the idea of the whole as a unit is under consideration employ a singular 
verb; as The regiment was in camp. (2) It is sometimes hard for the ordinary individual to 
distinguish the plural from the singular in foreign nouns, therefore, he should be careful 
in the selection of the verb. He should look up the word and be guided accordingly. "He 
was an alumnus of Harvard." "They were alumni of Harvard." (3) When a sentence with 
one verb has two or more subjects denoting different things, connected by and, the verb 
should be plural; as, "Snow and rain are disagreeable." When the subjects denote the 
same thing and are connected by or the verb should be singular; as, "The man or the 
woman is to blame." (4) When the same verb has more than one subject of different 
persons or numbers, it agrees with the most prominent in thought; as, "He, and not 
you, is wrong." "Whether he or I am to be blamed."
2.	Never use the past participle for the past tense nor vice versa. This mistake is a 
very common one. At every turn we hear "He done it" for "He did it." "The jar 
was broke" instead of broken. "He would have went" for "He would have 
gone," etc.
3.	The use of the verbs shall and will is a rock upon which even the best speakers 
come to wreck. They are interchanged recklessly. Their significance changes 
according as they are used with the first, second or third person. With the first 
person shall is used in direct statement to express a simple future action; as, "I 
shall go to the city to-morrow." With the second and third persons shall is used 
to express a determination; as, "You shall go to the city to-morrow," 
"He shall go to the city tomorrow."
With the first person will is used in direct statement to express determination, 
as, "I will go to the city to-morrow." With the second and third persons will is 
used to express simple future action; as, "You will go to the city to-morrow," 
"He will go to the city to-morrow."
A very old rule regarding the uses of shall and will is thus expressed in rhyme:
In the first person simply shall foretells,
In will a threat or else a promise dwells.
Shall in the second and third does threat,
Will simply then foretells the future feat.

4.	Take special care to distinguish between the nominative and objective case. 
The pronouns are the only words which retain the ancient distinctive case 
ending for the objective. Remember that the objective case follows transitive 
verbs and prepositions. Don't say "The boy who I sent to see you," but "The 
boy whom I sent to see you." Whom is here the object of the transitive verb 
sent. Don't say "She bowed to him and I" but "She bowed to him and me" since 
me is the objective case following the preposition to understood. "Between you 
and I" is a very common expression. It should be "Between you and me" 
since between is a preposition calling for the objective case.
5.	Be careful in the use of the relative pronouns who, which and that. Who refers 
only to persons; which only to things; as, "The boy who was drowned," "The 
umbrella which I lost." The relative that may refer to both persons and things; 
as, "The man that I saw." "The hat that I bought."
6.	Don't use the superlative degree of the adjective for the comparative; as "He is 
the richest of the two" for "He is the richer of the two." Other mistakes often 
made in this connection are (1) Using the double comparative and superlative; 
as, "These apples are much more preferable." "The most universal motive to 
business is gain." (2) Comparing objects which belong to dissimilar classes; as 
"There is no nicer life than a teacher." (3) Including objects in class to which 
they do not belong; as, "The fairest of her daughters, Eve." (4) Excluding an 
object from a class to which it does belong; as, "Caesar was braver than any 
ancient warrior."
7.	Don't use an adjective for an adverb or an adverb for an adjective. Don't say, 
"He acted nice towards me" but "He acted nicely toward me," and instead of 
saying "She looked beautifully" say "She looked beautiful."
8.	Place the adverb as near as possible to the word it modifies. Instead of saying, 
"He walked to the door quickly," say "He walked quickly to the door."
9.	Not alone be careful to distinguish between the nominative and objective cases 
of the pronouns, but try to avoid ambiguity in their use.
The amusing effect of disregarding the reference of pronouns is well illustrated 
by Burton in the following story of Billy Williams, a comic actor who thus 
narrates his experience in riding a horse owned by Hamblin, the manager:
"So down I goes to the stable with Tom Flynn, and told the man to put the 
saddle on him."
"On Tom Flynn?"
"No, on the horse. So after talking with Tom Flynn awhile I mounted him."
"What! mounted Tom Flynn?"
"No, the horse; and then I shook hands with him and rode off."
"Shook hands with the horse, Billy?"
"No, with Tom Flynn; and then I rode off up the Bowery, and who should I 
meet but Tom Hamblin; so I got off and told the boy to hold him by the head."
"What! hold Hamblin by the head?"
"No, the horse; and then we went and had a drink together."
"What! you and the horse?"
"No, me and Hamblin; and after that I mounted him again and went out of 
town."
"What! mounted Hamblin again?"
"No, the horse; and when I got to Burnham, who should be there but Tom 
Flynn,—he'd taken another horse and rode out ahead of me; so I told the hostler 
to tie him up."
"Tie Tom Flynn up?"
"No, the horse; and we had a drink there."
"What! you and the horse?"
"No, me and Tom Flynn."
Finding his auditors by this time in a horse laugh, Billy wound up with: "Now, 
look here, —every time I say horse, you say Hamblin, and every time I say 
Hamblin you say horse: I'll be hanged if I tell you any more about it."
SENTENCE CLASSIFICATION
There are two great classes of sentences according to the general principles upon 
which they are founded. These are termed the loose and the periodic.
In the loose sentence the main idea is put first, and then follow several facts in 
connection with it. Defoe is an author particularly noted for this kind of sentence. He 
starts out with a leading declaration to which he adds several attendant connections. 
For instance in the opening of the story of Robinson Crusoe we read: "I was born in 
the year 1632 in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my 
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull; he got a good estate by 
merchandise, and leaving off his trade lived afterward at York, from whence he had 
married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in the 
country and from I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of 
words in England, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name 
Crusoe, and so my companions always called me."
In the periodic sentence the main idea comes last and is preceded by a series of 
relative introductions. This kind of sentence is often introduced by such words 
as that, if, since, because. The following is an example:
"That through his own folly and lack of circumspection he should have been reduced 
to such circumstances as to be forced to become a beggar on the streets, soliciting 
alms from those who had formerly been the recipients of his bounty, was a sore 
humiliation."
On account of its name many are liable to think the loose sentence an undesirable 
form in good composition, but this should not be taken for granted. In many cases it is 
preferable to the periodic form.
As a general rule in speaking, as opposed to writing, the loose form is to be preferred, 
inasmuch as when the periodic is employed in discourse the listeners are apt to forget 
the introductory clauses before the final issue is reached.
Both kinds are freely used in composition, but in speaking, the loose, which makes the 
direct statement at the beginning, should predominate.
As to the length of sentences much depends on the nature of the composition. 
However, the general rule may be laid down that short sentences are preferable to 
long ones. The tendency of the best writers of the present day is towards short, 
snappy, pithy sentences which rivet the attention of the reader. They adopt as their 
motto multum in parvo (much in little) and endeavor to pack a great deal in small 
space. Of course, the extreme of brevity is to be avoided. Sentences can be too short, 
too jerky, too brittle to withstand the test of criticism. The long sentence has its place 
and a very important one. It is indispensable in argument and often is very necessary 
to description and also in introducing general principles which require elaboration. In 
employing the long sentence the inexperienced writer should not strain after the 
heavy, ponderous type. Johnson and Carlyle used such a type, but remember, an 
ordinary mortal cannot wield the sledge hammer of a giant. Johnson and Carlyle were 
intellectual giants, and few can hope to stand on the same literary pedestal. The tyro in 
composition should never seek after the heavy style. The best of all authors in the 
English language for style is Addison. Macaulay says: "If you wish a style learned, 
but not pedantic, elegant but not ostentatious, simple yet refined, you must give your 
days and nights to the volumes of Joseph Addison." The simplicity, apart from the 
beauty of Addison's writings causes us to reiterate the literary command—"Never use 
a big word when a little one will convey the same or a similar meaning."
Macaulay himself is an elegant stylist to imitate. He is like a clear brook kissed by the 
noon-day sun in the shining bed of which you can see and count the beautiful white 
pebbles. Goldsmith is another writer whose simplicity of style charms.
The beginner should study these writers, make their works his vade mecum, they have 
stood the test of time and there has been no improvement upon them yet, nor is there 
likely to be, for their writing is as perfect as it is possible to be in the English 
language.
Apart from their grammatical construction there can be no fixed rules for the 
formation of sentences. The best plan is to follow the best authors and these masters 
of language will guide you safely along the way.
THE PARAGRAPH
The paragraph may be defined as a group of sentences that are closely related in 
thought and which serve one common purpose. Not only do they preserve the 
sequence of the different parts into which a composition is divided, but they give a 
certain spice to the matter like raisins in a plum pudding. A solid page of printed 
matter is distasteful to the reader; it taxes the eye and tends towards the weariness of 
monotony, but when it is broken up into sections it loses much of its heaviness and the 
consequent lightness gives it charm, as it were, to capture the reader.
Paragraphs are like stepping-stones on the bed of a shallow river, which enable the 
foot passenger to skip with ease from one to the other until he gets across; but if the 
stones are placed too far apart in attempting to span the distance one is liable to miss 
the mark and fall in the water and flounder about until he is again able to get a 
foothold. 'Tis the same with written language, the reader by means of paragraphs can 
easily pass from one portion of connected thought to another and keep up his interest 
in the subject until he gets to the end.
Throughout the paragraph there must be some connection in regard to the matter 
under consideration,—a sentence dependency. For instance, in the same paragraph we 
must not speak of a house on fire and a runaway horse unless there is some connection 
between the two. We must not write consecutively:
"The fire raged with fierce intensity, consuming the greater part of the large building 
in a short time." "The horse took fright and wildly dashed down the street scattering 
pedestrians in all directions." These two sentences have no connection and therefore 
should occupy separate and distinct places. But when we say—"The fire raged with 
fierce intensity consuming the greater part of the large building in a short time and the 
horse taking fright at the flames dashed wildly down the street scattering pedestrians 
in all directions,"—there is a natural sequence, viz., the horse taking fright as a 
consequence of the flames and hence the two expressions are combined in one 
paragraph.
As in the case of words in sentences, the most important places in a paragraph are the 
beginning and the end. Accordingly the first sentence and the last should by virtue of 
their structure and nervous force, compel the reader's attention. It is usually advisable 
to make the first sentence short; the last sentence may be long or short, but in either 
case should be forcible. The object of the first sentence is to state a point clearly; the 
last sentence should enforce it.
It is a custom of good writers to make the conclusion of the paragraph a restatement or 
counterpart or application of the opening.
In most cases a paragraph may be regarded as the elaboration of the principal 
sentence. The leading thought or idea can be taken as a nucleus and around it 
constructed the different parts of the paragraph. Anyone can make a context for every 
simple sentence by asking himself questions in reference to the sentence. Thus—"The 
foreman gave the order"— suggests at once several questions; "What was the order?" 
"to whom did he give it?" "why did he give it?" "what was the result?" etc. These 
questions when answered will depend upon the leading one and be an elaboration of it 
into a complete paragraph.
If we examine any good paragraph we shall find it made up of a number of items, 
each of which helps to illustrate, confirm or enforce the general thought or purpose of 
the paragraph. Also the transition from each item to the next is easy, natural and 
obvious; the items seem to come of themselves. If, on the other hand, we detect in a 
paragraph one or more items which have no direct bearing, or if we are unable to 
proceed readily from item to item, especially if we are obliged to rearrange the items 
before we can perceive their full significance, then we are justified in pronouncing the 
paragraph construction faulty.
No specific rules can be given as to the construction of paragraphs. The best advice 
is,—Study closely the paragraph structure of the best writers, for it is only through 
imitation, conscious or unconscious of the best models, that one can master the art.
The best paragraphist in the English language for the essay is Macaulay, the best 
model to follow for the oratorical style is Edmund Burke and for description and 
narration probably the greatest master of paragraph is the American Goldsmith, 
Washington Irving.
A paragraph is indicated in print by what is known as the indentation of the line, that 
is, by commencing it a space from the left margin. (Devlin, 1910)

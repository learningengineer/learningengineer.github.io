        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you are taking this course, it's because you are not proficient in
          writing. It's ok. Lots of people have difficulty writing.
          Seventy-three percent of twelfth graders are not proficient in writing
          (National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2011), so you can see
          that you are not alone. However, writing is still the dominant form of
          communication: it's cheap and effective. Being able to write well is
          very important to your future professional life. Often times, students
          don't even realize how important writing is to their profession. Take
          culinary arts for example; you might not think that writing is that
          important to a culinary arts student, but think about this. In the UK,
          the chef Jamie Oliver is second in books sales only to JK Rowling
          (Harry Potter books) (NewsCore, 2010).</p>
        <p>Writing is important to your profession because it is a frequent
          method of communication with customers, co-workers, patients,
          civilians, etc. Miscommunicating with a customer can be costly if you
          mistated a quote or misplaced even a comma. For example, Oakhurst
          Dairy in Maine, lost it's overtime dispute with drivers because of a
          missing Oxford comma in a state law. You see, it all begins with a
          list of duties that are exempt from overtime pay; the problem is that
          the last items in the list�"packing for shipment or
          distribution"�aren't separated with a comma. The court ruled that
          these weren't separate items�"packing for shipment, distribution"�,
          but rather, they they were a two item list grouped together starting
          with packing. So, the court ruled that it's packing for shipment and
          packing for distribution, and since drivers don't pack, they aren't
          exempt from overtime pay. Truck drivers got $5 million in backpay
          (Gonzalez, 2018). So, the next time you think that this grammar stuff
          is for eggheads, just remember that the comma is for the blue-collar
          Jane and Joe Sixpack. But commas aren't the only point of contention.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Spelling mistakes can even be more costly. For example, the Yellow
          Pages changed "Exotic Travel" to "Erotic Travel," and it cost them
          $10,000,000. NASA lost a $5,000,000 satellite because someone
          mislabeled the measurements. Writing is the single-most important
          skill any professional can possess. Writing is a process. The writing
          process consists of five steps: prewriting, planning, drafting,
          revising, and proofreading. Expert writers don't follow all these
          steps in order; expert writers will skip around. In fact, expert
          writers will revise and proofread while drafting an essay. However,
          you are probably not an expert writer, so we will be looking at all of
          these steps in order.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapterTwo" class="chapts">
        <h2>Words</h2>
        <h3>How Language Shapes How You Think</h3>
        <p>The words you use shape the way you think. So, as you traverse your
          way through college, your vocabulary will expand, and that expansion
          will alter the way you perceive the world. For example, experts tend
          to see the world through their lens of expertise, such as when experts
          in baseball became confused by the word plate when it wasn't used to
          refer to home plate. In Australia, an aboriginal girl with eyes
          closed, knows exactly which direction is north. She knows immediately
          without hesitation. Ask that same question to a bunch of eggheads at
          Harvard, and first, there will be a pause, and then, maybe a guess or
          no answer at all. The aboriginal girl, it is believed, has this gift
          because of the structure of the language she uses whereby everything
          is referenced as a direction on the compass because their language is
          the language of traveling. They do not ask each other how they are
          doing, they ask each other where they are going and by going, they
          mean a specific direction. If you are limping, they might ask why your
          western leg hurts. Or about that new car parked on the north-side of
          your house. A dental student will no longer see teeth, they will see
          molars, incisors, and cuspids. A nursing student will no longer simply
          see the flu, they will see H1N3. Your language will become more
          precise and more accurate. However, the difficulty lay with figuring
          out how to relay complex information to the customer without confusing
          them, using the simplest terms and sentence structure possible without
          losing anything important. Words are the building blocks of language
          and writing. However, they are not indivisible. Words can be further
          broken down into prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Understanding some
          common word parts can help you when you encounter new words, increase
          your vocabulary, and help you to become a more proficient and
          successful writer. Words are to a writer what muscles are to an
          athlete. They are the raw form of how you shape what you do. The
          better your words, the better your writing. It's important to know a
          lot of different words because you have a lot of different people you
          communicate with. The language you use to talk to a judge in a
          courtroom will be much different than the language you use with a
          phone solicitor or someone who just cut you off in traffic. In
          writing, we call these writing styles. You use one writing style for
          emails with your boss and one writing style for text messages with
          your friends. When you're in college trying to get into a profession,
          it's important to learn the terms, words, and jargon of your field.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="exercisesChapterOne" class="chapts">
        <p> Exercise #1 The language of your profession or current major /
          program. What profession, major, or program are you trying to get
          into? Using the Internet find a reliable source that can give you an
          up-to-date list of the 50 most commonly used terms in your profession.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapterThree" class="chapts">
        <h2>What's Really Important</h2>
        <p>One of the first things beginning writers want to know is what is the
          most important aspect of writing. What should they focus on first?
          That's an easy question: facts and evidence. You see, I used to be an
          editor, and as an editor, I can tell you that it's pretty easy to fix
          grammar and punctuation that even a conscientious writer might miss,
          but I can't fix your false or missing facts or evidence. For example,
          a had a student tell me that the second amendment says that we have
          the right, "to keep and bear firearms," except that's not what the
          Constitution says. The Constitution doesn't use the term "firearms"
          just "Arms." This type of mistake undermines the credibility of the author, and credibility is everything when it comes to writing.  If you're not credible, no one is going to listen to you.  </p>
        <p>When an article is submitted to a publication like the New Yorker, it
          goes through an extensive review process. It begins with a "fact
          checker." This is an editor who reads through the article and checks
          to see that the statements made in it are accurate and factual. This
          is an important legal process for publications because of libel and
          defamation. For example, Gawker was sued for an article entitled, "The
          Greatest Scam in Tech." This article made a series of accusations
          against a company called Peep Telephony which you can find here, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/5726071/the-greatest-scam-in-tech"

            target="_blank">https://gizmodo.com/5726071/the-greatest-scam-in-tech</a>.
          In the article, the author makes quite a few derogatory comments about
          the Peep Telephony. However, the defamation suit was slapped down
          because the author had citations to back up his assertions. He used
          Peep Telephony's own videos and promotional materials. This is the
          type of thing a fact checker would look at. </p>
        <p>So, the most important thing in an essay, article, or research paper
          are facts that can be backed up with credible sources. Had the author
          of the Gawker article, not provided citations and examples from Peep
          Telephony, the lawsuit would probably have been affirmed for the
          plaintiff. You want to use facts supported by evidence because that's
          what saves you from a slander, defamation, or a libel lawsuit. </p>
        <p> The second most important thing is to avoid using logical fallacies
          and personal bias. Logical fallacies and personal biases both involve
          the writer making errors in logic. In the case of logical fallacies,
          the three that are most important to avoid are arguing from ignorance,
          false cause, and anecdotal.</p>
        <p>Arguing from ignorance means that you're writing about something that
          you don't really know anything about but think you do. An excellent
          example of this comes from an essay by a student entitled, "The
          Benefits of Being of Low Socio-Economic Status." In more simple terms,
          "It's Good to be Poor." Yes, that's right. This essay argued that the
          poor have it great. The essay claimed that the poor have everything
          paid for. If a poor person gets sick and must go to the hospital, it's
          completely covered. By contrast, middle-class people can have their
          car and home taken away if they don't pay their bills. This essay had
          no citations and no references. The information was based on hearsay
          and gossip. In other words, this essay had no basis in fact or
          evidence, but the student was still promoting it as true. The other
          side of arguing from ignorance is the "burden of proof."</p>
        <p> The Burden of Proof requires that a person who makes an assertion,
          accusation, or claim must prove those claims with direct and concrete
          evidence that is obvious. Without evidence, claims are considered
          false, and taken far enough, making false claims can be fraudulent.
          For example, the learning program Hooked on Phonics�, which costs
          approximately $230, settled with the Federal Trade Commission over
          claims it made in its commercials. Hooked on Phonics� claimed that it
          could teach anyone to read even those with reading disabilities like
          Dyslexia yet provided no evidence to support its claims in its
          commercial or to the FTC. Therefore, Hooked on Phonics� had to remove
          their commercials from television (Nathans, 2015). </p>
        <p>Another example involves a group of reactionaries who call themselves
          the Birthers. They have accused former President Obama of being a
          Kenyan, not an American, who is also Muslim, not a Christian, even
          though they present no evidence to support their absurd accusations.
          In fact, they have filed lawsuits against the former president;
          however, every single lawsuit has been thrown out by the courts.
          (Smith, 2009) Birthers harm our democracy by undermining the truth and
          spreading lies, making it difficult for voters to make informed
          decisions. To sum up the burden of proof, remember this pointed line
          from Mayor Bloomberg: "In God we trust, everyone else bring data."</p>
        <p>In addition to the burden of proof, we have the logically fallacy of
          false cause. False cause usually occurs when people confuse
          correlation or coincidence with causation. Just because two events
          coincide, it does not mean that one is the cause of the other.
          Correlation is easy to prove, causation is not. For example, one of
          the most popular topics for false cause is the drop in the murder
          rate. Some think that the drop was the result of abortion becoming
          legal (Levitt, 2015). Some think it because environmental lead, mostly
          from paint and gasoline, has been slowly removed from the environment
          (Casciani, 2015). And some even think that the murder rate has gone
          down because more people are surviving being shot due to the fact that
          level one trauma centers are near where crime occurs (Fields &amp;
          McWhirter, 2015). The problem here is that policies, which cost money,
          are made based on the belief that one thing causes another without any
          evidence that it does thus possibly wasting a lot of time and money. </p>
        <p> The other problem with false cause is that it has led to wrongheaded
          policies, such as doctors telling parents not to let their child sleep
          with the light on for fear it will cause short sightedness: it
          doesn't. It turned out that children with short-sightedness prefer to
          sleep with the light on (Smeets, 2012). This undermines the
          credibility of science. </p>
        <p> Another example comes from the field of education. Researchers in
          the 1970s noticed a correlation between self-esteem and good grades.
          This led some to conclude that if a child has high self-esteem, they
          will get good grades. However, this turned out to be false. In turns
          out that students with high grades have high self-esteem because of
          the accomplishment of having high grades. In fact, the result of the
          self-esteem movement is that we now have a lot of people who falsely
          think they are more intelligent than they are, which hurts their
          future career prospects by allowing them to falsely believe they are
          competent when they are not (Smeets, 2012).</p>
        <p> So, proving claims and writing logically are the two most imporant
          aspects of writing. After those two, organization is second.
          Organization involves two aspects of writing. Limiting what you're
          going to write about and then organizing those limited topics. A good
          rule to follow when writing on a topic is to pick three things about
          that topic to write about. For example, if you were writing a paper
          about logical fallacies, I would pick three to write about, probably
          the most commonly used by companies to sell products and only write
          about those three. Writing about all of them is a book or a huge
          website, it's not an essay. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="chapterFour" class="chapts">
        <h2>Picking Topics: Prewriting</h2>
        <p>Picking topics Picking topics to write about is one of the most
          difficult aspects of writing. Most writing classes overlook this, but
          students need it. Here are the rules of picking topics. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be original</li>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>Don't write about guns, abortion, marijuana, drunk driving or
              any other topic that has been done to death. There is nothing more
              boring and a bigger waste of the reader's time than you, the
              writer, rehashing the same old topic because you were too lazy to
              come up with something original. You can always lets someone else
              pick your topic for you.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>There are all kinds of essay and writing contests where the topic
            has already been selected. The key here is to find a new way of
            looking at the topic. An original point of view. For example, there
            is a contest essay about texting and driving. The instructions
            state, "The purpose of this scholarship is to help you understand
            the risks of texting while driving." So remember to emphasize the
            risks and the outcomes of those risks of texting while driving.</li>
          <li>Write what you know or what you are willing to learn about.</li>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>Take an inventory of your interests and knowledge. What do you
              know? For example, I know about fixing appliances, cars, bicycles,
              and computers. I know about cutting down trees and chopping wood.
              I know a lot about writing, editing, APA style, and science. And,
              if I don't know something, I am willing to learn about it but not
              in a superficial half-assed manner that isn't convincing like too
              many writers do. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>The best way to pick a topic is to take something that you're
            interested in and explore it further. </li>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>For example, let's say that you like listening to music, and you
              use the Pandora music streaming service. You could write about how
              the artists get paid. Or, you could write about why LP's are
              making a comeback. Or, what the difference is between analog and
              digital music.</li>
            <li>For instance, I am in education and I like music, so I could
              write about using music to enhance learning and provide examples
              of this.</li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>School House Rock</li>
              <li>They Might Be Giants: Science is Real.</li>
              <li>Pumps Your Blood: Happy Days</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div id="chapterFive-researching" class="chapts">
        <h2>Researching</h2>
        <p> Researching information for your writing requires work. Too often
          students skimp on this part, and it shows. In most cases, students
          have already come up with a thesis that they believe to be true and
          then find only that information that supports what they already
          believe to be true. This is called dogma, and it's bad practice. It's
          ok to start with a thesis; however, if the information and data don't
          support your thesis, you need to change your thesis and not look for
          information that agrees with you just because it agrees with you.</p>
        <h2>How to Research</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to perform research is with a search engine, usually
          at Google. However, you will want to perform specialized searches
          instead of generic searches. For example, instead of typing body
          cameras into a Google search box, type, site:gov body cameras. It will
          restrict your search to Government sites like the Department of
          Justice and the FBI. You could also perform a more an even more
          specific search by typing in site:fbi.gov body cameras. This search
          would only search through the FBI's website. You can do the same with
          any portion of a web domain name. If you're in any field of medicine,
          searching cdc.gov is a great idea. For business majors, searching
          bls.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics) is a great idea or the Small
          Business Administration at sba.gov.</p>
        <p>Using Wikipedia, WebMD, and other commercial sites. </p>
        <p> Don't use Wikipedia, WebMD or most commercial (.com) websites
          because in most cases they aren't primary sources of information.
          Wikipedia is secondary source of information. You can use secondary
          sources when doing research to help you find other sources. For
          example, in Wikipedia, the Footnotes are a treasure trove of primary
          source material that you can use. </p>

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>If you're a student, and you're writing about something other than
          yourself, you will need sources. You need credible sources because you
          don't even have a degree, so you aren't an expert enough in much of
          anything other than yourself. Think of it like this: would a judge
          consider you an expert witness? You may think that you are, but you
          aren't. It's a true fact. </p>
        <p>For example, I once read an essay that claimed we should drug test
          people on welfare because it would save money and because people in
          the military are drug tested. The problem is that neither claim is
          valid. First, drug testing has been tried many times, and it has
          always been a waste of money (Cunha, 2014). Second, military personnel
          are employees; they have an employment contract. People who receive
          welfare are receiving a public good entitled to them by law. They are
          presumed innocent until proven guilty before they can be denied this
          public good. In another example, a student claimed that the drinking
          age in the US has been 21 for hundreds of years. First, states
          determine their drinking ages, and in the state of Wisconsin, the
          drinking age was changed to 21 in the 1980s and not hundreds of years
          ago. How do I know? I was seventeen when the change first occurred. I
          was a primary witness to the change. </p>
        <p>There are two types of sources�primary and secondary sources. Primary
          sources are always more reliable and credible than secondary sources
          because they are closer to the event. </p>

              data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the exact methods

        <h2 id="fakenews">Fake News</h2>
        <h3>What is fake news? </h3>
        <p> Everyone makes mistakes and the news media is no different. Credible
          publications and broadcast stations print or state what are known as
          "Corrections." Corrections are notes or statements that correct past
          stories in previous editions. On the Internet, articles where mistakes
          have been made are corrected, but a note is placed at the bottom of
          the page noting the correction and what had been previously reported.
          This is called honesty. Honesty means credibility. Sometimes people
          confuse an honest mistake with a vast conspiracy yet provide no
          evidence of the conspiracy other than to point to a handful of
          cherry-picked mistakes that undoubtedly support some prior belief. </p>
        <p> Most fake news comes in the form of phony press releases from
          businesses or non-profit organizations owned by businesses looking to
          generate sensationalism or hysteria. One example is the website <a href="americaspower.org">americaspower.org</a>,
          which represents the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.
          There is no such thing as clean coal. It produces CO2 and mercury. The
          mercury from coal is the reason why you should restrict how much fish
          you eat. (CDC, 2016)</p>
        <h2>Facts and Evidence</h2>
        <p>Here is something that a student once wrote in an essay. </p>
        <p>She claimed that President Trump was a misogynist, weak minded and
          had a hatred for immigrants. None of her claims could be proven as
          true. Trump's wives have almost always had a roll [sic] within his
          company, his family immigrated as well as his current wife and has had
          to do some extensive damage control for himself over the years.
          Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton's slanderous ads had no prevail as Trump
          won the presidency and is currently the president.</p>
        <p>Let's look at what was stated here.</p>
        <p>First, the student claims that none of Hillary Clinton's claims could
          be proven true. This is false. Donald Trump is a misogynist because he
          was literally caught on a recording stating how he can grope women
          whenever he wants. He then apologized for what he said. A recording
          and a confession are plenty of evidence to support the claim.</p>
        <p>Second, the student claims that there is no evidence that Donald
          Trump has a hatred for immigrants. This ignores words that have come
          out of Donald Trump's own mouth. Does he have a hatred for all
          immigrants? No, just those that allow him to score political points.
          Let's look at some of the things Donald Trump has said about
          immigrants.</p>
        <p>"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're
          sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those
          problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're
          rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border
          guards and they're telling us what we're getting."</p>
        <p>Donald Trump provides no evidence to support his claims. In fact, his
          claims have been debunked by credible news outlets like the New York
          Times, which presents evidence to support its claims (Perez-Pena,
          2017).</p>
        <p>In another paper, a student claimed that Western medicine is missing
          out on "traditional" medicine. The problem is that there is only
          medicine. Treatments such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, and
          homeopathy need to be proven to be effective in randomized
          double-blind clinical trials or they are just more snake oil. You want
          to be able to support your assertions with facts and evidence and not
          speculation, hyperbole, or hysteria. If we don't, then we end up with
          Snake-oil salesmen peddling garbage and false hope. As future
          professionals, you have a duty to stand up for the truth and not some
          imaginary truth biased by our false beliefs. </p>
        <h3>Getting It Wrong</h3>
        <p>Sometimes writers, scientists, and politicians make mistakes.
          Sometimes they need to change their mind because they're wrong.
          Sometimes we must go with the information we have. For example, our
          understanding of gravity has changed throughout the years. Newton's
          gravity couldn't explain the path of the planet Mercury around the
          sun, but Einstein's could. Now Einstein's concept has been put to the
          test by the Voyager spacecraft, which is so far from earth and any
          form of gravity that it isn't where it is calculated to be. Therefore,
          science dictates that when the facts and evidence change so should our
          decisions. An inability to change your opinion based on the facts and
          evidence is unprofessional behavior. </p>

        <h2 id="planning">Planning and Outlining</h2>
        <p> Once you've done your research, you need to start planning your
          essay. This is important because it's going to save you a lot of time
          and effort. First, if you did your research correctly, you should have
          a lot more information than you can ever use. This is where an outline
          comes in handy. It is my experience that students who use outlines get
          better grades and waste less time writing. This is because the outline
          helps you think about what is and isn't important. </p>
        <p> Essays on broad topics need to be trimmed down because you're
          writing an essay and not a book. For example, I once read an essay by
          a student about Israel. The essay was very disorganized. One fact
          jumped to another unrelated fact. In one paragraph, the student is
          writing about the Dead Sea and in the next sentence about the Seven
          Day War. So, I simply started writing an outline, and I told the
          student to pick three things that they felt were important about
          Israel�just three. Not everything. </p>
        <p> An essay outline is very simple. Here is an example.</p>

            <ol type="i">
              <li>Instructional split attention occurs when learners are
                required to split their attention between and mentally integrate
                several sources of physically or temporally disparate
                information, where each source of information is essential for
                understanding the material. Cognitive load is increased by the
                need to mentally integrate the multiple sources of information.
                This increase in extraneous cognitive load is likely to have a
                negative impact on learning compared with conditions where the
                information has been restructured to eliminate the need to split
                attention. (Ayres and Sweller)</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Paraphrased: Split-attention occurs when the learner has to

            <li>Definition of what cherry-picking is. </li>
            <ol>
              <li>Cherry-picking is the selective use of data, subjects,
                intervals, and methods to support what someone already believes
                to be true. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Thesis: Three examples of cherry-picking are "No Excuses"
              Charter Schools, Vivobarefoot, and PBS Newshour. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>No Excuses Charter Schools </li>
          <ol>
            <li>No Excuses Charter Schools and charter schools in general use
              volunteers instead of a random selection students from public
              schools. The parents of children who go to Charter School are
              different than random parents because they are actively involved
              in their child's education and are more likely to be well-educated
              themselves. (Powers and Mathis) </li>
          </ol>
          <li>Vivobarefoot products are the new running shoes that look like a
            sock and require that the runner hits the ground with the front of
            their foot rather than the back. They claim that the Vivobarefoot
            leads to fewer injuries: "Harvard study proves that heel strikers
            have 2x the rate of injury as forefoot strikers." </li>
          <ol>
            <li>The problem is that the study didn't use a random selection of
              joggers from the general population of joggers, but rather, from
              52 almost "elite" level runners. Elite runners are more practiced
              and would thus be expected to have fewer injuries. So, the
              Vivobarefoot claim only counts for elite runners and not the
              average runner. </li>
          </ol>
          <li>PBS Newshour Story in which PBS cherry-picks data in its
            assertions against Success Academies. Example: "But our sources,
            including several public school principals, quite a few former
            Success Academy parents, and one person inside her organization,
            charge that is exactly what she does, repeatedly suspend certain
            kids to push them out. However, none of these critics were willing
            to publicly confront Moskowitz," according to John Merrow the
            reporter from the PBSNewshour. (Merrow) </li>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a style guide?&nbsp; A style guide consists
        of the rules of formatting and styling your paper.&nbsp; This includes
        how a title page is formatted, for example, where the pages are numbered
        and how a paper is cited.&nbsp; I have used several different styles
        over the years: Turabian, MLA, APA, and General Motors (Most
        corporations have their own style guides).&nbsp; Each time I was
        expected to adapt to the style being used because that�s what will be
        expected of you in the world of work.&nbsp; As of this writing, I have
        my students use the style guide used in their program areas.&nbsp; Most
        style guides have a published book that teaches you about it (<a href="Style%20Guides%09What%20is%20a%20style%20guide?%20%20A%20style%20guide%20consists%20of%20the%20rules%20of%20formatting%20and%20styling%20your%20paper.%20%20This%20includes%20how%20a%20title%20page%20is%20formatted,%20for%20example,%20where%20the%20pages%20are%20numbered%20and%20how%20a%20paper%20is%20cited.%20%20I%20have%20used%20several%20different%20styles%20over%20the%20years:%20Turabian,%20MLA,%20APA,+and+General+Motors+%28Most+corporations+have+their+own+style+guides%29.++Each+time+I+was+expected+to+adapt+to+the+style+being+used+because+that%92s+what+will+be+expected+of+you+in+the+world+of+work.++As+of+this+writing,%20I%20have%20my%20students%20use%20the%20style%20guide%20used%20in%20their%20program%20areas.%20%20Most%20style%20guides%20have%20a%20published%20book%20that%20teaches%20you%20about%20it%20%28https://www.amazon.com/Publication-Manual-American-Psychological-Association/dp/1433805618%29%20or%20you%20can%20simply%20use%20the%20APA%20own%20style%20blog%20at%20http://blog.apastyle.org++which+is+really+the+best+source+because+it+is+a+primary+source+direct+from+the+publisher+of+the+book+and+up-to-date.++Some+teachers+like+to+use+Purdue+University%92s+OWL+%28Online+Writing+Lab%29+as+a+source,%20but%20this%20is%20a%20secondary%20source%20and%20is%20completely%20uncited.%20%20In%20addition,+the+OWL+doesn%92t+have+a+citation+reference+for+a+government+source,+yet+government+sources+like+the+NIH+and+CDC+are+frequently+cited.++">https://www.amazon.com/Publication-Manual-American-Psychological-Association/dp/1433805618</a>)

        which is really the best source because it is a primary source direct
        from the publisher of the book and up-to-date.&nbsp; Some teachers like
        to use Purdue University�s OWL (Online Writing Lab) as a source, but
        this is a secondary source and is completely uncited.&nbsp; In addition,
        the OWL doesn�t have a citation reference for a government source, yet
        government sources like the NIH and CDC are frequently
        cited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="chapts">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, rather than using a

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the next step in the writing process. In
        drafting, you take your outline and the information you have gathered,
        and you write your essay.&nbsp; You want your first draft to be
        informally written.&nbsp; You want your writing to be readable, and you
        should write the way you speak.&nbsp; This is what I tell

      <div id="paraphrasing" class="chapts">
        <h2>Paraphrasing</h2>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writers use sources for their writing because in most
        cases, they aren�t experts. Good writers can take complex topics and
        make them easier for the reader to understand.&nbsp; Therefore, one of
        the most important tools in your writer�s toolbox is paraphrasing.&nbsp;
        You will paraphrase most of your sources.&nbsp; You can�t quote
        everything because that would make you an editor and not a writer.&nbsp;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step in paraphrasing is reading
        comprehension.&nbsp; You have to understand what you�re reading, and you
        have to understand all the concepts involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
        important because paraphrasing requires you to change everything from a
        source except the meaning of what is being stated.&nbsp; If you don�t
        understand your source, your paraphrased sentences will be
        worthless.&nbsp; Keep the meaning.&nbsp; Change everything else.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, for example, I have a sentence I copied from
        the <i>New Yorker</i> article �The Checklist� written by Dr Atul
        Gawande, �It was sleek and impressive, with a one hundred three-foot
        wingspan and four engines jutting out from the wings, rather than the
        usual two.�&nbsp; The first problem with paraphrasing this sentence
        starts with the word �it.�&nbsp; In order to paraphrase this sentence
        properly, you need to know what the word �it� is referring to (its
        antecedent).&nbsp; In this sentence, the word �it� is referring to the
        Word War II, B17 Bomber which was built by Boeing.&nbsp; <br>
        The second step in paraphrasing is changing the words with
        synonyms--different words same meaning.&nbsp; Again, it is important to
        remember that you have to keep the meaning of the original words and
        that you have to match same part of speech with same part of
        speech.&nbsp; You must replace verbs with verbs, adjectives with
        adjectives, and so on.&nbsp; If you use a different part of speech, the
        sentence becomes incoherent.&nbsp; For changing the words, I use a
        thesaurus.&nbsp; MS Word has a built-in thesaurus.&nbsp; If you right
        click on a word, you get a drop down list, and click on synonyms, which
        drops out and down to give you a list of possible synonyms.&nbsp; Click
        on one of the words, and it will replace the word jealousy in your
        text.&nbsp; <br>
        From there, you can also open up the thesaurus directly by clicking on
        thesaurus at the bottom of the list.&nbsp; In Word�s thesaurus, you can
        see a small (n.) next to the word protectiveness.&nbsp; This means that
        it is a noun, and you can see that all of the synonyms of jealousy are
        nouns, so this one would be easy to replace.&nbsp; <br>
        If you want or need a more extensive thesaurus, you can use the Power
        Thesaurus at <a href="https://www.powerthesaurus.org/">https://www.powerthesaurus.org/</a>
        This is the thesaurus I use for two reasons.&nbsp; First, it�s rather
        easy to use, and second, I don�t always use MS Word for writing and want
        to use something that is always available.&nbsp; In fact, I used it to
        help me write this paragraph.&nbsp; Initially, I wrote, �If you want or
        need a more comprehensive thesaurus...� I then changed �comprehensive�
        to �extensive.� <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our sentence, I am going to highlight all the
        words I want to find synonyms for. <br>
        <br>
        It was <mark>sleek</mark> and <mark>impressive</mark>, with a <mark>one
          hundred three foot</mark> wingspan and <mark>four engines</mark> <mark>jutting</mark>
        out from the wings, rather than the <mark>usual two</mark>. <br>
        <br>
        Once I completed the changes to the words, I ended up with�<br>
        <br>
        The B17 was streamlined and striking, featuring an almost 40 yard
        wingspan and a quartet of Boeing engines sticking out from the wings as
        opposed to most planes at that time which only had two. <br>
        <br>
        As you can see, certain words were impossible to change, such as
        wingspan and wings.&nbsp; Some words&nbsp; just can�t be replaced
        without making the sentence sound incoherent or awkward.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using the Power Thesaurus, you simply search for
        a synonym.&nbsp; Then, you can click on any of the recommended synonyms
        to find synonyms of that word.&nbsp; In fact, you can click on any of
        the words to see yet more synonyms.&nbsp; It�s a good idea to check out
        the Power Thesaurus and play around with the website to see what it
        offers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It�s important to be very careful about the words you
        are using.&nbsp; It�s always better to replace a complex word with a
        more simple word.&nbsp; In my paraphrased example, I replaced �jutting�
        with �sticking,� but originally, I wanted to use �extruding,� which I
        realized wasn�t the best choice for the reader. <br>
        <br>
        The third step in paraphrasing is changing the structure of the original
        sentence.&nbsp; Now, this isn�t always easy, nor is it always
        necessary.&nbsp; However, you should try it.&nbsp; I first try to flip
        the sentence around, rearranging any prepositional or participle
        phrases.&nbsp; Here is what I ended up with.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Most planes at this time had only two engines, but the B17, streamlined
        and striking, featured an almost 60 yard wingspan and a quartet of
        Boeing engines.<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        As you can see, I took the last part about how most planes had only two
        engines from the back of the sentence and put it at the front--very
        simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; From here, I can add an �although� to the beginning
        of the sentence and get rid of the �but� from the middle.&nbsp; So, now
        my final sentence ends up as. <br>
        <br>
        Although most planes at this time had only two engines, the B17,
        streamlined and striking, featured an almost 60 yard wingspan and a
        quartet of Boeing engines.<br>
        <br>
        To check my sentence, I do one final thing.&nbsp; I copy and paste it
        into a Google search to see if the New Yorker article shows up in the
        first page, and it doesn�t.&nbsp; There are also other plagiarism
        checkers that you can use, such as Quetext at https://www.quetext.com/,
        but I have found that Google works quite well, and you don�t have to
        sign up for it. </div>

        <h4>Broad to Narrow </h4>
        <p>Logical fallacies are used by almost everyone.&nbsp; They are easy to
          use because they require no facts or evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are
          very often used on Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube by politicians,
          advertisers, and conspiracy theorists.&nbsp; We kind of expect them
          from politicians and conspiracy theorists, but we should never see
          them used in healthcare.&nbsp; Used in healthcare, they can cause you
          to waste your money, injury, and even death.&nbsp; In healthcare,
          appeal to emotion, burden of proof, and false cause are probably the
          three most commonly used logical fallacies.&nbsp; </p>
        <h4>Narrow to Broad </h4>
        <p>In the movie, Thank You for Smoking, Aron Eckart�s character turns an
          argument about which flavor of ice cream, chocolate or vanilla, is
          better, into an argument about liberty and freedom.&nbsp; This is a
          strawman fallacy, and it occurs when someone misdirects a debate about
          one thing, such as which type of ice cream is better into something
          else.&nbsp; This allows the arguer to avoid having to deal with the
          actual topic that is being discussed.&nbsp; This is a popular fallacy
          for politicians to use.&nbsp; </p>
        <h4>Quotation</h4>
        <p>According to the professional skeptic Christopher Hitchens, �That
          which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without
          evidence.�&nbsp; Mr Hitchens believed that modern society was born on
          the concept that people need to prove their assertion before we should
          believe them.&nbsp; This belief is ingrained in our justice system:
          innocent until proven guilty.&nbsp; And the scientific method whereby
          controlled experiments prove that which has been asserted or
          theorized.&nbsp; Burden of proof...<br>

        <p>When I was a child, my parents often told us about Santa Claus who
          was an old overweight white guy who watched children as they slept and
          that if we weren�t good we wouldn�t get any presents on
          Christmas.&nbsp; Of course, eventually children begin to realize that
          Santa couldn�t possibly fit through the chimney or that he couldn�t
          possibly deliver presents to every child in the world within 24

          students a questionnaire that helps them to determine their learning
          style preference.&nbsp; The problem with this is that learning styles
          have no basis in science.&nbsp; They are what we call confirmation

        The best way to structure a supporting paragraph is to start with a
        topic sentence that is much like the thesis statement you read about
        earlier.&nbsp; The topic sentence should be a single sentence that
        summarizes or makes a statement about what the paragraph will be
        presenting.&nbsp; It�s often best to start with a vague topic sentence
        and then make it more specific after you write your paragraph.&nbsp; For
        example, let�s say I am going to write about the logical fallacy known
        as an appeal to emotion.&nbsp; I might start my paragraph with a
        statement like, �Appeals to emotion are common.�&nbsp; Then, I will
        start writing.&nbsp; After my topic sentence, I will want to provide a
        definition of what an appeal to emotion is.&nbsp; Then, I will want to
        provide a real-world example, such as the Cheerios commercial �Breakfast
        with Nana.�&nbsp; You don�t want to use a made-up example like those you
        find at logical fallacy websites because they don�t help the reader
        apply them in real life.&nbsp; You want to use real examples of appeals
        to emotion, so that the reader can see the context that they are used
        in.&nbsp; After you have your example, you�ll want to explain how it is
        an appeal to emotion.&nbsp; For example, in Breakfast with Nana, a
        little girl asks her mom if Cheerios was the same back when her mom was
        a little girl as it is now.&nbsp; The mom responds with a yes, it was
        the same.&nbsp; To that the little girl replies, �So when we have
        Cheerios, it�s like we�re having breakfast with Nana.�&nbsp; A tear then
        forms in Mom�s eye because grandma has obviously passed away.&nbsp;
        Leveraging the death of a grandparent to sell some cereal is an obvious
        appeal to emotion.&nbsp; </div>

        Here is a body paragraph on the ad hominem fallacy. </div>
      <div class="chapts"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="chapts">An ad hominem fallacy is often referred to as name
        calling.&nbsp; This logical fallacy occurs when people attack the person
        making the argument with irrelevant name calling.&nbsp; For example,
        claiming that a woman doesn�t know anything about fixing a car because
        she is a woman, is an ad hominem attack because being a woman has
        nothing to do with being able to fix a car.&nbsp; These are popular
        because people often believe the name calling when the person being
        attacked doesn�t respond to the name calling.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
        pointing out that someone is arguing from ignorance is not an ad-hominem
        attack because ignorance or the lack of knowledge, facts or evidence is
        relevant to the discussion.&nbsp; </div>

        <h3>Cause and Effect Essay</h3>
        <p>A tear fell to my dad�s cheek as he sat my family down to explain
          that he had a rare form of kidney cancer. I had never seen him cry
          before, and no further explanation was needed to emphasize the
          enormity of the situation. <br>
          It was then, at the young age of twelve, that I was first introduced
          to a urological pathology. Not only did I begin to learn of the
          kidneys' important role in physiology, but I also gained an immense
          respect for surgeons: the wild nature of the operative arena and the
          dangers associated with it. During the operation, my dad's inferior
          vena cava was inadvertently damaged, necessitating the transfusion of
          ten units of blood. Despite my age, I was able to take in the gravity
          of the situation and process the dangers that our patients are exposed
          to when they go "under the knife." At the same time, I was fascinated
          with the definitive nature of his surgical intervention: my dad, with
          the help of his urologists, beat cancer with surgery alone and didn't
          require adjuvant treatment.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don�t think any child of twelve imagines
          himself or herself as a career urologist, but life takes unexpected
          turns.&nbsp; Although my family's experience served to ignite my keen
          interest in medicine, it was not until recently that my aspirations
          came full circle. Throughout medical school, I have endeavored to
          master both preclinical and clinical knowledge and have a true passion
          for exceeding expectations as an intern�no matter the rotation. During
          my family medicine and psychiatry rotations, I welcomed the
          communication and relationships that are fostered, but was often left
          longing for a conclusive treatment that would bring my patients'
          illnesses to an end. After being introduced to the operating room
          during my ob-gyn rotation, I started to strongly consider pursuing a
          career involving surgical intervention: as the swift nature of our
          work and the immediate results were a form of gratification that I had
          not yet experienced. The general surgery clerkship that followed
          solidified my resolve to become a surgeon and allowed myself time to
          experience the responsibilities of surgeons from a variety of fields.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment of clarity while backpacking in
          the Rocky Mountains with my younger brother, I was suddenly able to
          answer the deceivingly difficult question, "What aspects of a
          profession are most important to me?� It became apparent that a career
          requiring both proficiency in communication about guarded topics and
          the expertise of a surgeon would bring me the most satisfaction. I
          pride myself on my communication skills and look forward to employing
          them in order to elicit my patients� most sensitive and personal
          concerns. In addition, it is my belief that playing the violin and
          guitar since grade school has allowed me to develop a level of fine
          motor control that will make me a great surgeon. In a perfect
          amalgamation of my dad's battle with cancer, a desire for career
          balance and breadth, an interest in men's health, and academics, I
          decided that becoming a urologist would be the only way to preserve
          all of the aspects that turned me towards the field of medicine in the
          first place. <br>
          &nbsp;Despite being a surgical sub-specialty, the occupation
          encompasses an extremely diverse array of disease processes and
          respective treatments. There is an exquisite balance of medical and
          surgical management that, in my opinion, is unparalleled in other
          areas of medicine. It follows that urologists perform at the pinnacle
          of clinical reasoning and at a level of expertise that interposes
          wonderfully with the high expectations I have for myself.
          Additionally, I envy the urologist's role in men's health as many men
          present with genitourinary complaints because they have failed to
          establish healthy habits. This allows the urologist not only to
          address the presenting complaint, but also to play a role in
          preventive medicine and establish the life-long relationships that
          stem from an intimate continuity of care. <br>
          Longing for a career that is dually devoted to healthcare as well as
          academia, which the culture of urology embraces, I have always had a
          fascination with science and intend to spend my career contributing to
          urologic research. Furthermore, as an anatomy tutor, I have recognized
          that I enjoy and have a natural gift for teaching and plan to play an
          active role in the education of medical students and residents alike
          after becoming an attending physician.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The competition for a urology residency is stiff�a
          fact that deters many from the field. I see the path as a challenge
          that I will take pleasure in overcoming. A fear of the unknown and the
          uncertainty that surrounds the undertaking has only served to motivate
          me on my endeavor. This attitude was instilled in me at a young age
          when confronted with my dad's health concerns, and as I ventured to
          become the first medical doctor in my family. With this perseverance
          and drive, I aim to exceed expectations and let the long-standing
          reputation of medicine and academia at [insert program name] mold me
          into a urologist who will contribute immensely to the field, allowing
          me to complete the journey that I unknowingly began as I watched my
          dad cry for the first time ever. <br>

        <h3>Example Essay on Logical Fallacies</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logical fallacies are all around us.&nbsp; A
          politician claiming that his opponent can't be trusted because he or
          she is some kind of socialist or communist undermines the truth and
          our democratic political system by causing distrust amongst
          voters.&nbsp; A baseball player using an elaborate ritual because it
          is what he did the last time he got on base allows him to believe that
          it isn�t hard work and long hours of practice that makes him a great
          player, but rather the ritual itself.&nbsp; At times, it may be a
          fraudulent business enterprise, such as Reebok� toning shoes, which
          don�t do anything different than regular shoes, that make
          unsubstantiated claims about its product�s effectiveness that lead
          consumers to waste their money and time on a product that is
          useless.&nbsp; And finally, it could be someone claiming to be the
          victim of some imaginary harm, such as when nine grade school students
          in California claimed that their future wages that they haven�t earned
          yet are harmed by teachers having �due process� rights.&nbsp; False
          claims of harm waste the time and money of the court system, which
          should be dealing with real harm and not imaginary harm.&nbsp; Logical
          fallacies are errors in logic that people often make because the truth
          doesn't fit into their world view.&nbsp; Appeal to emotion, burden of
          proof, and false cause are probably the three most common logical
          fallacies that cause harm.<br>
          Appeal to Emotion<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeal to emotion is one of the most popular
          logical fallacies.&nbsp; The appeal to emotion is an attempt to
          sidestep facts and evidence for an appeal to someone�s emotions.&nbsp;
          Advertisers love appeals to emotions because it hijacks the decision
          making process when purchasing things like food.&nbsp; For example,
          Cheerios features a commercial where a young child asks her mom if
          grandma had Cheerios.&nbsp; The mother responds with a yes, and so the
          child replies back with the conclusion that when they are eating
          Cheerios, it is like they are having breakfast with Nanna, and a tear
          wells up in Mom�s eye.&nbsp; Notice that Cheerios isn�t telling us how
          good it tastes or how healthy it is, just that it is like eating
          breakfast with a dead loved one.&nbsp; The logical problem is, of
          course, that grandma isn't at the breakfast table and Cheerios can't
          actually raise the dead.&nbsp; Consumers need facts and evidence to
          make good purchasing decisions and appeals to emotion hinder that
          decision making process. <br>
          Burden of Proof<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The burden of proof is another common logical
          fallacy.&nbsp; This fallacy involves making assertions or accusations
          that have no basis in fact or evidence.&nbsp; Taken far enough, making
          false claims can be fraudulent.&nbsp; For example, the learning
          program Hooked on Phonics�, which costs approximately $230, settled
          with the Federal Trade Commission over claims it made in its
          commercials.&nbsp; Hooked on Phonics� claimed that it could teach
          anyone to read even those with reading disabilities like Dyslexia, yet
          provided no evidence to support its claims in its commercial or to the
          FTC.&nbsp; Therefore, Hooked on Phonics� had to remove their
          commercials from television. (Nathans)&nbsp; Consumers can save
          themselves lots of money by only purchasing products that have been
          proven to be effective through controlled experiments.&nbsp; Another
          example involves a group of reactionaries who call themselves the
          Birthers. They have accused President Obama of being a Kenyan, not an
          American, who is also Muslim, not a Christian, even though they
          present no evidence to support their absurd accusations.&nbsp; In
          fact, they have filed lawsuits against the president; however, every
          single attempt has been thrown out by the courts.&nbsp; (�Barack Obama
          presidential eligibility litigation�) Birthers harm our democracy by
          undermining the truth and spreading lies, making it difficult for
          voters to make informed decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up the burden of
          proof, remember this pointed line from Mayor Bloomberg: �In God we
          trust, everyone else bring data.�&nbsp; <br>
          False Cause<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we have the logically fallacy of false
          cause.&nbsp; False cause usually occurs when people confuse
          correlation or coincidence with causation.&nbsp; Just because two
          events coincide, it does not mean that one is the cause of the
          other.&nbsp; Correlation is easy to prove, causation is not.&nbsp; For
          example, one of the most popular topics for false cause is the drop in
          the murder rate.&nbsp; Some think that the drop was the result of
          abortion becoming legal (Levitt).&nbsp; Some think it because
          environmental lead, mostly from paint and gasoline, has been slowly
          removed from the environment (Casciani).&nbsp; And some even think
          that the murder rate has gone down because of the fact that more
          people are surviving being shot due to the fact that level one trauma
          centers are near where crime occurs (Fields &amp; McWhirter).&nbsp;
          The problem here is that policies, which cost money, are made based on
          the belief that one thing causes another without any evidence that it
          does thus possibly wasting a lot of time and money.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other problem with false cause is that it has
          led to wrongheaded policies, such as doctors telling parents not to
          let their child sleep with the light on for fear it will cause short
          sightedness: it doesn't.&nbsp; It turned out that children with
          short-sightedness prefer to sleep with the light on (Smeets).&nbsp;
          This undermines the credibility of science.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example comes from the field of
          education.&nbsp; Researchers in the 1970s notices a correlation
          between self-esteem and good grades.&nbsp; This led some to conclude
          that if a child has high self-esteem, they will get good grades.&nbsp;
          However, this turned out to be false.&nbsp; In turns out that students
          with high grades have high self-esteem because of the accomplishment
          of having high grades.&nbsp; In fact, the result of the self-esteem
          movement is that we now have a lot of people who falsely think they
          are more intelligent than they are, which hurts their future career
          prospects by allowing them to falsely believe they are competent when
          they are not (Smeets).<br>
          Conclusion<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize, the burden of proof, false cause, and
          appeal to emotion are common logical fallacies that are used by people
          often to mislead or manipulate.&nbsp; Now that you know some of them,
          you can protect yourself against the snake-oil salesmen of the
          world.&nbsp; <br>

          The Split-Attention Effect <br>
          I am a teacher.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; It says so on my Wisconsin
          state issued certification.&nbsp; Although I work at a technical
          college, I have a degree in the science of education, which means I
          understand the statistics and methods of doing a proper educational
          study.&nbsp; I am familiar with the language of my profession.&nbsp; I
          can discuss the merits and problems of scaffolding, grades,
          metacognition, assessments, and teacher evaluations.&nbsp; However,
          over the years, I have learned that the most important lessons in
          education are rarely learned in a classroom.&nbsp; No one explains to
          you why math is so difficult or why you always seem to miss
          information when taking notes.&nbsp; However, the split�attention
          effect explains both.&nbsp; Math is difficult because the explanations
          found in books are spatially separate from what is being
          explained.&nbsp; Learning about the split�attention effect will help
          you become a better <br>
          student and safer person. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the spli-t�attention effect?&nbsp;
          According the Cambridge Handbook of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          Multimedia Learning, the split�-attention occurs as follows: <br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> Instructional split attention occurs when learners are
          required to split their attention between and mentally integrate
          several sources of physically or temporally disparate information,
          where each source of information is essential for understanding the
          material. Cognitive load is increased by the need to mentally
          integrate the multiple sources of information. This increase in
          extraneous cognitive load is likely to have a negative impact on
          learning compared with conditions where the information has been
          restructured to eliminate the need to split-attention. (Ayres and
          Sweller) </blockquote>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Quite simply, it refers to what happens when, as a student, you
        need to combine information from two different sources that are
        separated by time or space. For instance, when children first learn to
        tie their shoes, it is common for the parent to demonstrate the process
        before the child makes an attempt.&nbsp; This is an illustration of
        temporal or time separation.&nbsp; The child has to remember the entire
        process before being able to make an attempt.&nbsp; To illustrate a
        spatial one, we need only look at an <br>
        ordinary math book.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Math books often combine a text based explanation
        with an equation, chart, or diagram that are separated on the page
        spatially, which means that the explanation is on one part of the page
        while the equation or diagram is on another part of the page. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, the text appears first with a parenthetical
        reference to the equation, such as (See Fig. 4-5).&nbsp; <br>
        I noticed the split�attention effect while I was taking a statistics
        course from UW Madison via correspondence.&nbsp; I found that as I was
        using the book, I was jumping back and forth between the explanations
        and the equations so much so that I really wasn�t understanding what was
        going on.&nbsp; It wasn�t until I recorded the text and played it back
        while studying the equation that I really started to understand because
        I could listen to the explanation while looking at the diagram.&nbsp;
        They were no <br>
        longer separated by space.&nbsp; My grade went from a D to an A.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the split�-attention effect can also be an
        issue when driving a car. <br>
        This is why texting and driving is so dangerous.&nbsp; The driver is
        splitting their attention between driving their car and texting on the
        phone.&nbsp; Both are separated spatially; you can�t look at two things
        at the same time.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this isn�t just confined to texting while
        driving this would also apply to doing anything other than
        driving.&nbsp; Prior to cell phones, drivers could be found being
        distracted by their car stereo, friends, putting on makeup, or even, as
        I have personally seen, someone reading a book.&nbsp; All require you to
        split your attention and in so doing make for unsafe driving conditions.
        <br>
        &nbsp; Another over�looked example of the split-�attention effect is
        taking notes. Like many students, you find yourself sitting in class
        listening to a teacher drone on while you furiously take notes; however,
        you must split your attention between listening and writing.&nbsp; Every
        time you write something down, you aren�t listening and so can miss
        something important.&nbsp; The problem is that you have to read what you
        write while you are writing, so you can�t be listening.&nbsp; It is
        better to actively listen <br>
        to the lecture rather than listen and write. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, the split-�attention effect is a
        common phenomenon that undermines whatever process you are involved in
        whether it is taking notes in class, driving a car, or studying from a
        math book.&nbsp; To compensate, reduce the time or spatial distance
        between the separate sources of information or simply don�t get involved
        in splitting your attention.&nbsp; It could save your life.

        Primary and Secondary Sources of the Civil War<br>
        Blackhawk Technical College<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil War was the most divisive time in American
        history.&nbsp; It pitted a Constitution that allowed for the enslavement
        of a whole group of people based on the color of their skin against a
        Declaration of Independence that listed the self-evident truth that all
        men are created equal and that they are endowed with certain inalienable
        rights.&nbsp; If you don�t believe me, you can look at Lincoln�s
        Gettysburg Address, which was given during the war itself, upon a
        battlefield where so many had died in that fight.&nbsp; It begins, �Four
        score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a
        new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
        all men are created equal.&nbsp; Now we are engaged in a great civil
        war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
        dedicated, can long endure.�&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gettysburg Address is a primary source of
        information about the Civil War because it was written during the war by
        the president at the time.&nbsp; It allows us a glimpse into his thought
        process, and his view of the war.&nbsp; Primary sources like the Address
        are much better than secondary sources because they allow us to witness
        it ourselves rather than have someone explain it to us, and the Civil
        War has lots of primary source material to draw from.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary sources, in case you didn�t know, are
        documents, photographs, videos, letters, and other materials that were
        made or produced at the time of the event by those directly
        involved.&nbsp; These sources should be unedited and in as raw a form as
        possible. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil War, for example, was the first war to have
        photography available to it.&nbsp; One of the most famous photographs
        was that of runaway slave Mr Oliver Gordon�s scarred back taken in
        1863.&nbsp; This primary source was physical proof to abolitionists and
        unionists of the brutality and moral bankruptcy of slavery.&nbsp; It
        inspired thousands of freed and enslaved African Americans to join the
        union army.&nbsp; (Matthew Brady Studio, 1863)</div>
      <img class="slaveback" src="https://npg.si.edu/sites/default/files/teacher_resources_gordon.jpg"

        alt="Oliver Gordons scarred back" title="Oliver Gordons scarred back">
      <div class="chapts">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another primary source from the
        Civil War were the thousands and thousands of letters written by
        soldiers on either side of the war.&nbsp; These letters allow us to look
        at the everyday struggles and experiences of these soldiers whether they
        were at Gettysburg, Shiloh, Vicksburg, or the horrors of Georgia�s
        Andersonville prison.&nbsp; One such letter was written by Riley M
        Hoskinson of Illinois to his wife in which he describes his
        experiences.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sept. 17. Still all well here. Negley's Division gone
        before us towards the enemy. Gen. Thomas Army Corps are also gone in
        front of us and we (for the first time since in the service) left in the
        rear. Just at sunrise, boom goes a cannon, its fearful sound
        reverberating from mountain to mountain. Our men raise one long loud
        shout of joy. Soon several more followed in quick succession, then all
        silence for over an hour (Hoskinson, 1863). And, there are thousands of
        these letters that anyone can read in their original form or
        transcribed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, secondary sources use primary sources to
        create a new document of what happened by editing primary sources
        together to create a narrative or story about the events that
        happened.&nbsp; <br>
        Secondary sources for the Civil War are just as abundant.&nbsp; A simple
        search at Amazon.com books reveals over 100,000 entries.&nbsp; However,
        the most famous secondary source of the Civil War is Ken Burn�s The
        Civil War documentary.&nbsp; At the time it aired, it was falsely
        believed that Americans didn�t have the attention span to watch a 12
        hour documentary (Burns, 1990); however, it ended up being the most
        watched series on PBS ever with 13.9 million viewers on its first
        night.&nbsp; (Carter, 1990).&nbsp; It featured the thousands of
        photographs taken during the war and the letters of soldiers sent
        home.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, primary and secondary sources are
        very different.&nbsp; Primary sources are raw and unedited but also
        disconnected from each other and the larger picture; whereby, secondary
        sources are more connected but lack the pureness of a primary
        source.&nbsp; <br>

        <p>Persuasive Essay from John Norland<br>

        <h2><br>
        </h2>
        <h2>Writing Conventions</h2>
        <p>Writing conventions refers to the rules of writing, such as the
          proper use of grammar, punctuation, and mechanics.&nbsp; These rules
          are important because they help prevent the reader from being
          confused.&nbsp; There are also legal and monetary matters to
          consider.&nbsp; For example, the AT&amp;T Yellow Pages once misspelled
          the word �exotic,� replacing it with �erotic� in a travel agency
          advertisement.&nbsp; The lawsuit that followed cost AT&amp;T $10
          million.&nbsp; In an article by the BBC, they estimate spelling
          mistakes cost online sellers millions of dollars in lost income each
          year (Coughlan, 2011) .&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that mistakes erode
          the credibility of the writer and credibility is important to
          employers and customers.</p>
        <h3>What is a sentence?</h3>
        <p>A sentence is a complete thought that contains a subject and a verb,
          which can be implied.&nbsp; For example, let�s say you ask a
          rhetorical question like this one from Stephen Colbert�s book,<i> I Am
            America (And So Can You!)</i>.&nbsp; <br>
          �Well, like a lot of other dictators, there is one man's opinion I
          value above all others. Mine.�&nbsp; <br>
          You will notice that the second sentence contains only one
          word�mine.&nbsp; In this sentence, both the subject and the verb are
          implied.&nbsp; The implied subject is �it� and the implied verb is
          �is.�&nbsp; �It� refers to �one man�s opinion.�&nbsp; So, if you wrote
          the sentence out completely it would be, �It is mine.�&nbsp; However,
          in speech, we often just shorten these sentences to save time.&nbsp;
          Sentences that have implied subjects and verbs can never be the first
          sentence in a paragraph.&nbsp; You�ll notice that without the
          information from the previous sentence, the �Mine,� sentence wouldn�t
          make sense.</p>
        <h2><span style="font-family: Quattrocento;">The rules of writing.&nbsp;
            <br>
          </span></h2>
        <p>Rule #1: Don't confuse the reader.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>We have rules for grammar and punctuation to help us achieve our
          communication goals.&nbsp; Because we want the reader to listen,
          understand, empathize with what we have to say, it's important that
          our writing is credible, and credibility comes from applying the rules
          of writing in a consistent manner.&nbsp; Inconsistent spelling,
          punctuation, and grammar are a distraction to the reader and get in
          the way of understanding and credibility.&nbsp; So, always apply what
          rules you do know, consistently. </p>
        <p>Rule #2: Look up the word or answer or rule.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you don't know a rule, look it up.&nbsp; It's a slap in the face
          to the read when writers are too lazy to look something up.&nbsp; If
          you're not sure, look it up.&nbsp; Cite the source.&nbsp; It adds
          credibility.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Here are some great places to look things up.</p>
